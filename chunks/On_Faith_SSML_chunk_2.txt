    <s>For those who neglect to turn away from their wickedness and promise themselves God's indulgence are sometimes overtaken by God's sudden wrath, so they neither find the time for conversion nor the benefit of forgiveness.</s> 
    <s>Therefore, sacred Scripture kindly warns each of us, saying: Do not delay to turn to God, and do not put it off from day to day: for His wrath will come suddenly, and in the time of vengeance, He will destroy you. (Sirach 5:8).</s> 
    <s>Blessed David also says: Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts. (Psalm 95:8).</s> 
    <s>Blessed Paul agrees with these words: See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. (Hebrews 3:12-13).</s> 
    <s>Thus, one who lives hardened and does not convert, either desperate for the forgiveness of their sins or hoping for God's mercy while remaining in the perversity of their crimes until the end of their present life, lives in despair.</s>

    <s>39. Sin against the Holy Spirit.</s> 
    <s>Therefore, loving God's mercy and fearing His justice, let us neither despair of the forgiveness of sins nor remain in our sins, knowing that the justice of the most righteous judge will exact from all men what the mercy of the most merciful Redeemer has not forgiven.</s> 
    <s>For just as mercy receives and absolves the converted, so justice will repel and punish the hardened.</s> 
    <s>These are the ones who sin against the Holy Spirit, and they will not receive forgiveness of sins either in this world or in the future.</s> 
    <s>The human soul is an intellectual spirit, meant to seek, recognize, and discern both the time of its works, for which it will receive in judgment what divine justice has ordained, and the time of that retribution, when it will not be possible to change its works or usefully ask for the forgiveness of its sins from divine mercy.</s> 
    <s>But the spirits of all animals, which lack intellect, because some originate from the earth and some from the waters (for reptiles and birds are from the waters, while some that creep and some that walk are from the earth), are spirits only as long as they live in bodies.</s> 
    <s>For a soul that is not made capable of reason by divine will begins and ends life with its flesh: because when it does not give life to the body, it does not live itself.</s> 
    <s>Thus, in a miraculous way, while the soul is the cause of life for all flesh, the irrational spirit lives as long as it can remain in the flesh, and when it is separated from its flesh, it is extinguished.</s> 
    <s>So it happens that, though it is the life of its flesh, it cannot live when it ceases to give life to the flesh; and if there is no flesh to which it can give life, it will not have life itself.</s> 
    <s>Therefore, neither eternality is given to irrational spirits, nor any judgment prepared for them, in which they are rewarded with happiness for good deeds or punished for bad ones.</s> 
    <s>Therefore, no distinction of works is required in them because they have received no faculty of understanding from God.</s> 
    <s>For this reason, their bodies will not be resurrected, because there was neither righteousness nor wickedness in their souls for which eternal happiness or punishment could be given.</s>

    <s>For this reason, humble servants of Christ, who want to serve their Lord without hindrance and without the distraction of the mind, do not desire marriage at all, and abstain from meat and wine as much as their health allows.</s>
    <s>Not because it is a sin to have a spouse or to consume wine and meat: for even the blessed Apostle says: "For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer" (1 Timothy 4:4-5).</s>
    <s>God also instituted and blessed marriage in the first humans (Genesis 2:22).</s>
    <s>Wherefore the Apostle says: "Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled" (Hebrews 13:4).</s>
    <s>Therefore, the servants of God, in abstaining from meat and wine, do not avoid them as unclean things, but follow the practices of a purer life, and in not having marriages, they do not consider the good of marriage to be a crime, but they do not doubt that perpetual continence is better than good marriages: especially in this time, when it is said of continence: "He who is able to accept it, let him accept it" (Matthew 19:12); but it is said of marriage: "If they cannot contain, let them marry" (1 Corinthians 7:9).</s>
    <s>In the one, virtue is encouraged by exhortation, in the other, weakness is alleviated by remedy.</s>
    <s>Wherefore, because sickness must always be consulted, if someone first happens to be deprived of a spouse, if they wish to enter into a second or even a third marriage, they will have no sin in it, if they maintain chastity, that is, if one man and one woman, only lawfully joined, keep faith, so that neither the man mixes with a woman other than his wife, nor the woman with a man other than her husband in any way.</s>

    <s>Just as, according to the Apostle's judgment (1 Corinthians 7:3), it is right for a husband to give his wife her due, and likewise the wife to her husband, because if a man takes a wife, he does not sin, and if a virgin marries, she does not sin, so, according to the same Apostle's word, he who has determined in his heart, being firm, having no necessity, and having power over his own will, and has vowed continence to God, ought to keep it with all the care of his mind until the end, lest he have condemnation if he makes void his first faith.</s>
    <s>Likewise, married men or married women, if by mutual consent they have vowed perpetual continence to God, should know that they are bound by their vow, and no longer owe the mixing of the flesh, which was lawful at first, but owe the continence to God which they have vowed.</s>
    <s>Then each one will possess the kingdom of heaven, which is promised to the saints, if forgetting what is behind, and stretching forward to what is ahead, as it is said in the Psalms: "Vow, and pay to the Lord your God" (Psalm 76:11), what he knows to be lawful, and for the advancement of a better life.</s>

    <s>So too, the Apostle John commends the Son as the true God, saying: "We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know the true God, and we are in His true Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life" (1 John 5:20):</s>

    <s>This eternal nature is also indicated in the Psalms where it says: "But God is our King before the ages" (Psalm 74:12); and in another place, "His eternal power and divinity" (Romans 1:20).</s>

Corb. But edd., in vision.] when He came. That voice, by which God the Father alone spoke; and that flesh, by which the Only Begotten God alone became man; and that dove, in whose form the Holy Spirit descended upon Christ; and those tongues of fire (Acts 2:3), in whose division the faithful [Note: The editors, faithful apostles.

Hold firmly and do not doubt at all that only God the Son, that is, one of the persons of the Trinity, is the Son of God the Father alone; but the Holy Spirit, also one of the persons of the Trinity, is the Spirit of both the Father and the Son. For the Son of God, showing that He alone is begotten of the Father, says [Note: Ms. one, He shows . . . when he says.]: For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son (John 3:16); and a little later, He who does not believe is already judged, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God (Ibid., 18). The Apostle teaches that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of both the Father and the Son, who says: But you are not in the flesh but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you (Romans 8:9). And it follows [Note: Mss. three, and having followed, he says.], If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His (Ibid.).

For the Son says: When the Spirit of truth comes, who proceeds from the Father (John 15:26); where He taught that it is His Spirit, because He is the Truth (John 14:6). The prophetic and apostolic doctrine also commends to us that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son. For Isaiah says of the Son: He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips He will kill the wicked (Isaiah 11:4). And the Apostle also says of Him: Whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of His mouth (2 Thessalonians 2:8). Indicating that He is the breath of the mouth of the only Son of God, after His resurrection, He breathed on the disciples and said: Receive the Holy Spirit (John 20:22). And John says in Revelation about the Lord Jesus that a sharp double-edged sword came out of His mouth (Revelation 1:16). Therefore, the breath of His mouth is the sword that proceeds from His mouth.

It is also said of the Wisdom of God, which is His Son, that it reaches from end to end mightily and orders all things sweetly (Wisdom 8:1).

    <s>But because good can both decrease and increase in it, it is called evil to the extent that its good is diminished.</s> 
    <s>For evil is nothing else but the absence of good.</s> 
    <s>Hence it is clear that there are two kinds of evil in rational creatures: one by which they voluntarily fell away from their highest good, their creator, and another by which they will be unwillingly punished with the eternal fire; suffering the latter justly because they committed the former unjustly; and because they did not maintain the order of divine institution within themselves, they will not escape the order of divine retribution.</s>

    <p>
        But indeed, those who cannot believe by their own will, nor do penance for the sin they originally inherit, the sacrament of faith and penance, which is holy baptism, as long as their age of reason cannot grasp it, is sufficient for salvation.

        <s>The unity of ecclesiastical society is so valuable for salvation that baptism does not save unless it is given where it ought to be given.</s>
        <s>Baptism, however, is present in a person baptized even outside the Church, but it is present to judgment in those separated from the Church.</s>
        <s>And because it is clear that wherever it is given, this baptism is to be given once, therefore, even if it is given by heretics in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, it must be recognized with reverence and not repeated because of this.</s>

    <s>Chapter 43, also known as Rule 40: The wicked mixed with the good in the Church.</s>

    <s>84. Hold firmly and do not doubt that the Catholic Church is the threshing floor of God, and within it, until the end of the world, chaff is mixed with the wheat, that is, the wicked are mixed with the good in the communion of sacraments.</s>
    <s>And in every profession, be it clerics, monks, or laypeople, there are both good and bad; and the bad do not harm the good.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    Do not abandon the good because of the bad, but tolerate the wicked to the extent required by faith and the principle of charity. This means tolerating them if they neither sow seeds of deceit within the Church nor lead the brothers to any deadly work of imitation. No one within the Catholic Church who believes rightly and lives well can ever be stained by another's sin if they do not consent to or support the sinner. It is beneficial for the wicked to be tolerated by the good within the Church if, by living well and giving good counsel, they cause the wicked to reject their evil ways and to fear God's judgment for their evil deeds. In this way, through the gift of grace, they may be ashamed of their iniquities and, by God's mercy, turn to a good life.
  </p>
  <p>
    The good should be separated from the wicked within the Catholic Church only by the difference in their deeds. Those who share in the divine sacraments should not share in the evil deeds of the wicked. At the end of the world, the good will be separated from the wicked even physically when Christ comes with His winnowing fork in His hand. He will clear His threshing floor, gather His wheat into the barn, and burn the chaff with unquenchable fire (Matthew 3:12). In His just judgment, He will separate the righteous from the unrighteous, the good from the wicked, and the upright from the perverse. He will place the good on His right and the wicked on His left. According to the eternal and unchangeable sentence from His mouth, the wicked will go into eternal fire, while the righteous will go into eternal life (Matthew 25:45). The wicked will burn forever with the devil, while the righteous will reign endlessly with Christ.
