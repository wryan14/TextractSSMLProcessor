Warning in the Letter of Saint Prosper to Saint Augustine.

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:02:00,959
Saint Augustine spent most of his life refuting various heretics. After achieving complete victory for the Church over the Arians, Manichaeans, and Donatists, he faced the Pelagian heresy, which opposed the grace of God. From 412 onward, he tirelessly fought against it, writing books on the Remission of Sins, the Baptism of Infants, and more, whenever opportunities arose. Eventually, the heresy was condemned by several councils of bishops and decrees from the highest pontiffs. As a result, it began to lose strength, and its number of defenders dwindled.
However, in the later years of this holy Doctor, some men—otherwise Catholic but either less educated or not sufficiently versed in the Scriptures from which Augustine drew his doctrine—were disturbed or even scandalized after reading Augustine's books. The disturbances among the monks of Adrumetum in Africa, who were obedient to Abbot Valentine, were easily settled by Augustine's book on Grace and Free Will and another on Correction and Grace, which cleared up their doubts.
But a much greater danger to the Church, especially in Gaul, came from another offshoot of the Pelagian heresy. This new strain spread more widely and took deeper root, partly because it initially seemed less harmful to the grace of Christ the Savior and even appeared to amplify it. The beginnings of this new doctrine were seen with Vitalis, a man otherwise Catholic, who, having been educated in the Church of Carthage, owed special veneration to the doctrine of Saint Cyprian, the bishop of that city. However, Augustine complained that Vitalis recklessly departed from this doctrine, as mentioned in Letter 217. Although Augustine did not believe Vitalis to be a Pelagian heretic, he did hear that Vitalis was not entirely orthodox and that some errors might have influenced him or remained in him, as Augustine himself writes in Letter 217.

3
00:02:00,959 --> 00:04:02,351
They attribute the aspects of a faithful and pious life to free will, believing that such qualities should come from us, not from the Lord. However, they did not want the beginning of faith, which is also the beginning of good, or pious will, to be a gift from God. Instead, they argued that we should initiate it ourselves so that we may begin to believe.
As for the other good things in a religious life, they agreed that God grants them through His grace to those who already seek, ask, and knock in faith. Augustine refuted this error of Vitalis, which was embraced by those known as Semipelagians, primarily in a letter written to Vitalis himself. He argued that the Church offers prayers to God for unbelievers so that they may be converted, and gives thanks for those who have already been converted to faith; and also offers prayers for the faithful, that they may persevere in what they have begun through His gift. This letter to Vitalis seems to be later than the dissension of the Adrumetines and the books written to address it, and should be dated to the year 426 or 427.
However, as Augustine’s later writings spread far and wide, many in Marseilles and other places in Gaul, out of ignorance, convinced themselves that whatever Augustine had written against the Pelagians about the calling of the elect according to God's good pleasure was entirely contrary to the opinion of the Fathers and the sentiment of the Church. They believed that this doctrine caused both the holy and the sinful to become negligent and lukewarm, because, no matter how they acted, nothing else could happen to them than what God had determined.
Therefore, even if that doctrine were entirely true, they argued it should not be publicized, as it was not necessary and could lead to very dangerous effects, making exhortations and encouragements vain and ineffective. This alienation from Catholic doctrine, from which they drew such negative conclusions, led them into the well-known errors of the Semipelagians, for they rightly earned this name.

4
00:04:02,351 --> 00:05:35,591
They once held better and more orthodox beliefs, but without firm rules and foundations, their minds and opinions kept shifting back and forth.
They believed that the beginning of faith and perseverance until the end were entirely within our control and not gifts from God. They thought that such perseverance was given by God, but a person could still fall away by their own will.
Some deviated so slightly from the Pelagian path that they recognized no other grace than reason and free will, given to man by the Creator without any prior merit.
Those who embraced these errors were distinguished individuals, gaining great authority among simpler people through their zeal for virtues and their reputation for honesty.
However, none are more prone to accepting the impious doctrines of the Pelagians, unless they guard themselves carefully, than these; nor are there any who more easily abuse God's gifts by becoming proud and attributing them to themselves, than those who have been most abundantly endowed by Him.
A large part of the servants of Christ in Massilia, particularly the monks, had been infected by this pestilence. It's well known that John Cassian, who established a monastery there, propagated this same error in his writings, especially in the thirteenth conference he published in 426, just one year after Valentinian the Third ordered the expulsion of the Gallic bishops who followed Pelagius's doctrines.
This error was further reinforced by the fact that some of its defenders had recently attained the highest honor of the priesthood, the episcopate.

5
00:05:35,591 --> 00:07:32,375
Hilary, who was the bishop of Arles and succeeded Honoratus around the end of the year 428, was a follower and admirer of Augustine's teachings in most respects.
However, he was troubled by and somewhat critical of Augustine's views on predestination.
He wished to discuss his thoughts on this matter with the holy teacher.
The authority of such illustrious men, prominent in the Church and in piety and dignity, made their error more dangerous both to themselves and to others.
The due reverence shown to them led the unlearned to imitate them, and at the same time silenced the tongues of the more knowledgeable.
As a result, there was hardly anyone who would either admonish them or counter the error they were teaching, except for a few fearless lovers of perfect grace, as mentioned in the letter of Saint Prosper to Augustine, number seven.
Among this number were Saint Prosper, and a certain Hilary, different from the bishop of Arles.
This Hilary was from the order of laymen, as we will demonstrate in more detail below, in the letter of admonition to Saint Augustine that follows the one we are discussing here.
Saint Prosper, who later succeeded Augustine in the task and effort of defending grace, was from Aquitaine.
He was scholarly in speech, highly educated, and distinguished in both character and eloquence, as well as zeal.
He was not unworthy of acquaintance with Saint Augustine, although he himself indicated that he was only from the order of laymen, where he professed to be far from equal to the authority of the aforementioned Semipelagians, who surpassed him in both the merits of life and the highest honor of the priesthood, according to Gennadius, Catalog, chapter eighty-four.
He had never seen Augustine but had only greeted him with respectful letters, which he sent through the deacon Leontius, from whom he also received a response from the holy bishop.
We rightfully lament that these letters from both parties to each other no longer survive.

6
00:07:32,375 --> 00:09:10,223
However, through constant reading of Augustine's works and divine revelation from above, he learned it was extremely wrong to say that the beginning of salvation lies with the one who is saved, rather than with the one who saves. By denying predestination and preceding grace, and asserting that human will assists divine grace, he overlooked that grace actually subjects the human will to itself.
Ignoring the opposition, he not only persisted in this belief but also defended it against its critics. He used both the works of the holy doctor and the scriptural testimonies cited there, as well as his own arguments based on Augustine's foundations. He fought with strong reasoning and forceful assertions, which, according to the testimony of Gennadius, he possessed.
Initially, the people of Marseilles preferred to blame their own lack of understanding rather than condemn a doctrine they did not comprehend. Some even wanted to consult Augustine for a clearer explanation on the matter.
But, by the will of the merciful God, around that time, the book "On Rebuke and Grace" was brought to Marseilles. In this book, Augustine responded so fully and completely to the same issues troubling the monks of Adrumetum, as those troubling the people of Marseilles, that it seemed the book was written to settle the disputes in Gaul.
Upon seeing the book, those who followed Augustine's apostolic doctrine found new light and greater support for defending it. But others, whose minds had been previously clouded by error, found only further offense and more intense hatred for the truth.
Defending their opinion in the name of tradition, they branded the doctrine of predestination as something novel.

7
00:09:10,223 --> 00:11:08,807
The passages of Paul relevant here were said to have never been understood by anyone. When asked how they themselves would explain them, they admitted that no interpretation satisfied them. They demanded silence about things whose depth no one had reached.
They cited the opinions of Augustine from works composed before the Pelagian heresy, as if these opinions fully agreed with their own views. Indeed, they vigorously repeated everything the same Augustine had opposed to himself in the book On Rebuke and Grace as supporting their position. However, they greatly disliked the distinction made there between the grace given to Adam and the grace given to us now.
Finally, they did not want the example of predestination to be taken from infants, about whom Augustine had also had a different opinion earlier in the books On Free Will.
When the defenders of the truth were oppressed by the authority of those whom the spirit of Pelagian impiety had deluded, they were compelled by the holy bishop to request that he himself use his authority against them.
On this matter, Hilary wrote two letters to him, the first of which is lost, and perhaps referred to the odious formula of preaching predestination, which Augustine mentioned his opponents had used against him in Book Two on the Predestination of the Saints, chapter twenty-two, number fifty-seven.
In the second letter, after addressing the complaints of the adversaries, Hilary said, "Whatever you wish or are able to do for that grace, which we admire in you from the least to the greatest, we will most gratefully receive, as if it were a decree from our most dear and reverend authority."
He indicated that he had also urged Prosper to write his own letter on the same matter, which he sent along with his own. Those are the letters of Prosper that we present here, where he testifies at the beginning that he writes to the holy doctor not only out of a desire to greet him, as he had done in a previous (now lost) letter, but also out of affection for the faith by which the Church lives.

8
00:11:08,807 --> 00:12:30,000
Because you are diligently keeping watch over all the members of the body of Christ and fighting against the traps of heretical teachings with the power of truth, I believed there was no reason to fear that I would be a burden or inconvenience to you in matters concerning the salvation of many and your devotion. Instead, I felt I would be guilty if I did not bring to your attention those things I understand to be very harmful to the special patron of faith.
After explaining the considerable virulence present in the remnants of Pelagian depravity, he adds: We hope that not only will our insignificance be strengthened by the support of your arguments, but that even those renowned for their merits and honors will, having received the purest light of grace, be cleared of the darkness of this opinion.
This letter from Saint Prosper was written in the year 428 or 429, around the time when Hilary governed the Church of Arles. From number nine, it is evident that Hilary became the bishop of Arles after being a monk at Lérins, following Honoratus, who died at the beginning of the year 428 or 429. Honoratus succeeded Patroclus, who, according to Prosper's Chronicle, was killed in the year 426.
Honoratus occupied the seat of Arles for two years, according to Honoratus of Marseilles in the Life of Hilary of Arles.

Saint Prosper of Aquitaine
Latter to Augustine

10
00:12:34,152 --> 00:13:57,648
On the remnants of the Pelagian heresy emerging in Gaul and the complaints against the doctrine of predestination and grace, as explained in Augustine's works, especially the book "On Rebuke and Grace."
To the most blessed lord, the ineffably marvelous, incomparably honorable, most excellent patron,
AUGUSTINE, from
PROSPER.
Although unknown to you by face, yet already somewhat known to you in spirit and word, if you remember; for through my holy brother Leontius the deacon, I sent letters and received them.
Now also, I dare to write to your blessedness, not only out of a desire for greeting, as then, but also with the affection of the faith by which the Church lives.
With your diligent watch over all members of the body of Christ and your fight against heretical doctrines with the power of truth, I did not consider it a burden or an importunity to reach out to you regarding matters of salvation, and thus, to your piety.
Rather, I believed I would be guilty if I did not bring what I understand to be very pernicious to the special patron of faith.
Therefore, many servants of Christ residing in the city of Marseilles think that what you disputed in your writings against the Pelagian heretics about the calling of the elect according to God's purpose is contrary to the opinion of the Fathers and to the ecclesiastical sense.
When they preferred to blame their own slowness rather than criticize what they did not understand, some wished to request a clearer and more open explanation from your blessedness on this matter. It happened, by God's mercy, that when some in Africa were troubled by similar issues, you published the book "On Rebuke and Grace," full of divine authority.

11
00:13:57,648 --> 00:15:26,279
By an unexpected opportunity, this matter was brought to our attention. We thought all complaints from the dissenters should be silenced because every question for which we needed your holiness's advice was so fully and completely answered there, as if you had made it your special effort to settle the troubles we had.
After reviewing this book of your blessedness, those who already followed the holy and apostolic authority of your teaching became much more knowledgeable and well-informed; while those who were hindered by their own unclear beliefs withdrew even more opposed than they were before.
This abrupt disagreement is firstly to be feared for their own sake, lest the spirit of Pelagian impiety deceives such illustrious men devoted to all virtues; and secondly lest the simpler ones, among whom these dissenters are greatly respected for their perceived integrity, consider it safest to accept what they hear these people, whose authority they follow without judgment, assert.
This is their definition and profession:
While every man indeed sinned in Adam's sin, and no one is saved by their own works but by God's grace through regeneration, yet the atonement in the sacrament of Christ's blood is offered to all men without exception, so that whoever wishes to come to faith and baptism can be saved.
Moreover, God foresaw before the foundation of the world those who would believe and those who would remain in that faith, which would thereafter be aided by God's grace, and predestined them to His kingdom, foreseeing that they would be called freely, would become worthy of election, and would depart from this life with a good end.
Therefore, every man is urged by divine institutions to believe and to hope, so that no one despairs of attaining eternal life, since a reward is ready for willing devotion.

12
00:15:26,279 --> 00:17:06,935
This proposed calling of God, by which, either before the beginning of the world or at the creation of humanity, the distinction between those to be chosen and those to be rejected is said to have been made, so that, according to what pleased the Creator, some are created as vessels of honor and others as vessels of dishonor. This removes the care of rising again from the fallen and brings an opportunity for lukewarmness to the saints, because in both cases, labor is excessive if neither the rejected can enter by any effort nor the elected can fall away by any negligence. For no matter how they conduct themselves, nothing else can happen to them than what God has determined.
The course cannot be steady under uncertain hope since if the choice of the predestiner has something else, the intention of the striver is in vain. Thus, all effort is removed, and virtues are taken away if God's decree precedes human wills. Under this name of predestination, a certain fatal necessity is introduced, or it is said that the Lord is the creator of different natures if no one can be other than what they were made to be.
To explain more briefly and fully what they think, whatever your holiness has opposed to itself in this book from the sense of contradictors, and whatever you powerfully refuted in the books against Julian under this question, all of this is most vehemently proclaimed by these holy ones. And when we bring forth the writings of your blessedness, equipped with the strongest and innumerable testimonies of the divine Scriptures, and according to the form of your debates, we also build upon something to conclude them, they defend their obstinacy with tradition and assert that those things brought from the Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Romans to manifest the divine grace preceding the merits of the elect have never been understood by any church leaders as they are now.
And when we demand that they explain these things according to the sense of whomsoever they wish, they declare that they find nothing that pleases and require silence about those things whose depth no one has reached.

13
00:17:06,935 --> 00:18:33,528
Finally, their stubbornness has reached a point where they claim our faith is contrary to the edification of listeners. They argue that even if it is true, it shouldn't be proclaimed, because harmful teachings should not be accepted, and things that cannot be understood should be kept silent to avoid any danger.
Some of them deviate only slightly from the paths of the Pelagians. When they are forced to acknowledge the grace of Christ, which precedes all human merits, they say that if it were given based on merits, it would be called grace in vain. They believe this condition applies to each person, with the grace of the Creator establishing them as rational beings with free will, without any prior merit, because they did not exist before. This allows them to direct their will through the discernment of good and evil, to the knowledge of God, and to obedience to His commandments. They believe that by asking, seeking, and knocking through natural ability, they can reach the grace by which we are reborn in Christ: so that they receive because they made good use of the good of nature, they find because they sought, they enter because they knocked, and thus they merit reaching this saving grace with the help of initial grace.
However, they define the purpose of calling grace as God determining to take no one into His kingdom except through the sacrament of regeneration, and that all men are universally called to this gift of salvation, whether through natural law, written law, or gospel preaching. This way, those who wish to become children of God, and those who do not want to be faithful, are without excuse: because God's justice is shown in that those who do not believe perish; His goodness is evident in that He repels no one from life, but wants all to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth.

14
00:18:33,528 --> 00:20:05,736
Here they present testimonies where the exhortation of the Holy Scriptures encourages people to obey, who from free will either follow the commands or neglect them. They believe that because a transgressor is said not to have obeyed because he did not want to, a faithful person should also undoubtedly be considered devout because he wanted to. Each person has as much ability for good as for evil, and the mind can move equally towards vices or virtues, supported by the grace of God when seeking good, and justly condemned when pursuing evil.
When confronted with the multitude of countless infants who, except for original sin, under which all humans are born equally into the condemnation of the first man, have no wills or actions of their own yet, they are not separated without God's judgment. Before they can discern good and evil through the experience of this life, some are taken up as heirs of the heavenly kingdom through rebirth, while others pass into the debt of eternal death without baptism. They say that such are lost and such are saved, as God’s divine knowledge foresaw what they would be like in later years if they had been preserved to an active age.
They do not consider that the grace of God, which they say accompanies human merits, not precedes them, is even subjected to those wills that they do not deny are anticipated by it according to their own imagination. But they subject God's election to any fabricated merits to such an extent that they invent past things that do not exist and future things that will not happen. In a novel kind of absurdity, things that are not to be done are foreknown, and things foreknown are not done.
They seem to think this prescience of human merits, according to which the grace of the caller operates, is much more reasonable when it comes to contemplating those nations which were left to follow their own ways in past ages (The Acts of the Apostles).

15
00:20:05,736 --> 00:21:47,688
Even today, at 14:15, some still perish in the ignorance of old beliefs, untouched by the light of the Law or the Gospel.
However, wherever preachers have had the opportunity, the people who lived in darkness and the shadow of death have seen a great light.
This is written in Isaiah chapter 9, verse 2, and in Matthew chapter 4, verse 16.
Those who were once not a people are now the people of God. Those to whom He once did not show mercy, now He shows mercy, as stated in Hosea chapter 2, verse 24, and in Romans chapter 9, verse 25.
They say that the Lord foresaw their belief and arranged the times and ministries of the teachers so that the will to believe would arise in each nation.
This doesn't contradict the idea that God wants all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth, as found in First Timothy chapter 2, verse 4.
Those who could have been led to worship the one true God by natural understanding and did not hear the Gospel because they would not have accepted it are inexcusable.
However, our Lord Jesus Christ died for the whole human race, and no one is excluded from redemption by His blood, even if they go through life estranged from Him.
The sacrament of divine mercy is available to all, though many are not renewed because it is foreseen that they would not want to be renewed.
Therefore, as far as God is concerned, eternal life is prepared for all. But in terms of free will, it is embraced by those who willingly believe in God and have received the help of grace through their belief.
Regarding the preaching of such grace, those who contradict it, despite once holding better beliefs, have especially claimed it for themselves.
If they acknowledged that all good merits are preceded by grace and given by it so they can exist, they would have to concede that God, according to His purpose and counsel, makes one vessel for honor, another for dishonor, as stated in Romans chapter 9, verse 21.
No one is justified except by grace, and no one is born except in sin.

16
00:21:47,688 --> 00:23:12,480
But they refuse to admit this and are afraid to attribute the merits of the saints to divine work. They won't accept that the number of the predestined elect can neither be increased nor decreased, fearing they would lack incentives to encourage the unfaithful and the negligent. They believe that effort and labor would become pointless, and the endeavor in vain, if election ceases. They think that each person can only be called to correction or improvement if they know that their diligence can make them good, and that their free will needs God's help to achieve this if they choose what God commands.
So, among those who have received the freedom of will, they believe two things work for human salvation: God's grace and human obedience. They want obedience to come before grace, so that the beginning of salvation is believed to come from the one who is saved, not from the one who saves. They think that the human will should bring divine grace to itself, not that grace should subject human will to itself.
Since we know from the revelation of God's mercy and your blessed instruction that this is the most perverse belief, we can indeed firmly reject it. However, we are not equal in authority to those who hold such views, as they far surpass us in the merits of their lives. Some of them have recently attained the highest honor of the priesthood, and scarcely anyone, except a few fearless lovers of perfect grace, has dared to oppose the arguments of such superior men.
As a result, the danger has grown not only for those who listen to them but also for those who are listened to, as their dignity leads many either to useless silence out of reverence or to thoughtless agreement. And it seems to them most beneficial what is scarcely criticized by anyone.

17
00:23:12,480 --> 00:24:53,135
Since in these remnants of Pelagian depravity, a considerable amount of poison is nurtured, if the beginning of salvation is wrongly attributed to man; if human will is impiously placed before divine will, so that someone is helped because they wanted it, not because they were helped to want it; if someone originally bad is wrongly believed to start receiving good not from the highest good, but from themselves; if God is pleased by something other than what He has given: grant us in this matter, most blessed Pope, most excellent father, as much as you can with the Lord's help, the diligence of your piety, so that the things in these questions that are obscure and difficult to understand may be opened up by your most illuminating explanations.
First, because many do not think the Christian faith is violated by this disagreement, reveal how much danger is in their persuasion; then how through this preoperative and cooperative grace, free will is not hindered; then whether God's foreknowledge remains according to purpose, so that those things that are proposed are accepted as foreknown: or whether these matters vary by types of causes and kinds of persons; so that because the callings are different, in those who are saved without doing anything, only God's purpose seems to exist; but in those who are going to do some good, the purpose can stand by foreknowledge: or indeed uniformly, even though foreknowledge cannot be separated from purpose by temporal distinction, foreknowledge is still in a certain order supported by purpose; and just as there is nothing of any business that divine knowledge has not anticipated, so there is nothing good that has not flowed into our participation without God as the author. Finally, how through this preaching of God's purpose, by which the faithful become those who are preordained to eternal life, none of those who are to be exhorted are hindered, nor do they have an occasion for negligence if they despair of being predestined.

18
00:24:53,135 --> 00:26:25,104
Please also explain how this can be resolved.
We ask for your patience and understanding as you guide us, since after re-evaluating previous opinions on this matter, nearly all come to the same conclusion.
They accepted God's purpose and predestination based on His foreknowledge.
For this reason, God made some vessels for honor and others for dishonor, because He foresaw the end of each one, and knew their future will and actions under the same grace and assistance.
With all these issues clarified, and many others which you can see more clearly with greater insight into this matter, we believe and hope that our limited understanding will be strengthened by your discussions, and that those distinguished by merit and honors, clouded by this opinion, will receive the purest light of grace.
One of their foremost authorities and a man of spiritual studies, Saint Hilary of Arles, knows that your blessedness admires and follows your teachings in all other matters.
He wishes to convey his thoughts to your holiness through his letters about this matter which he brings into dispute.
But because it is uncertain whether he will do this, or with what outcome, and considering the fatigue of us all, by the grace of God providing for this present age, we rest in the strength of your charity and knowledge:
Add instruction to the humble, add rebuke to the proud.
It is necessary and useful to write down what has been written, so that it is not considered trivial, which is not frequently challenged.
For they think it is healthy because it does not hurt; they do not feel the wound covered by skin; but let them understand that it will come to cutting, what has a persistent swelling.
May the grace of God and the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ crown you at all times, and glorify you as you walk from strength to strength forever, most blessed lord pope, ineffably wonderful, incomparably honorable, most excellent patron.

19
00:26:25,104 --> 00:28:25,991
WARNING ON THE LETTER OF SAINT PROSPER OF AQUITAINE TO RUFINUS
Three things can be investigated about the letter to Rufinus:
1. Who Rufinus is, to whom this letter was given;
2. When it was written;
3. On what occasion and necessity Saint Prosper was compelled to write it.
As for Rufinus, it is not easy to determine who he was among the many known by this name around that time, nor have we found it definitively established by anyone until now.
It is certain that he was a friend of Saint Prosper, and one of those whom spiritual friendship makes concerned for the well-being of their friends.
Hence, when he heard confused rumors about the disputes raised against the doctrine of Saint Augustine, and learned that his most beloved friend Prosper was being poorly spoken of by many, he feared for the salvation of the soul most dear to him.
Not daring to condemn him with a hasty judgment without hearing him out, he chose to address him in writing, as he was perhaps separated by a long distance and could not do so in person.
He entrusted these letters to a mutual friend to deliver.
Unless perhaps you prefer to think that he gave instructions to a departing friend to personally express his pious concern without writing.
Neither option seems certain, but it is judged that one of them certainly happened, based on the opening words of Saint Prosper's letter:
"I received," he says, "through our mutual friend, the signs of your brotherly concern for me, and I gratefully acknowledged your sincere charity.
And lest any malicious rumors, as far as they cannot be kept from your ears, bring you any fear or anxiety, I took care to clear you of all doubt as much as possible through my letter, striving so much to reveal everything to you with the fullest truth, so that because you could not hear all that is spread by our opponents, through me you can know whatever is said and spread about us to cause vain envy."
Regarding the time of this writing, it can be asserted without doubt that it was composed while Augustine was still alive, but in the last years of this great master.

20
00:28:25,991 --> 00:30:30,455
What certainly makes these words of this letter undeniable is the reference to the Most Blessed Augustine, a prominent figure among the Lord's priests at this time. At the end of the letter, it says: "So that the preaching of the highest man in the Church at this time, etc."
The final years of the life of the holy doctor are clearly demonstrated by the accusations from French detractors and slanderers of Saint Augustine's works. They were greatly offended by the reading of the book "On Rebuke and Grace," written around the year 426 or 427 for the instruction and correction of the monks of Adrumetum.
Saint Prosper describes these critics when he says: "To this, that is, to the Most Blessed Augustine, among so many triumphs and honors, for the enlightenment of the Church and the glory of Christ, some of our own people (which is very regrettable) speak against him with secret, but not unknown, whisperings."
And as they find receptive ears, they defame his writings, which attack the error of the Pelagians. They claim that he completely removes free will and, under the name of grace, preaches fatal necessity. They also add that he believes in two masses of the human race and two natures, attributing to such a pious man the impiety of pagans and Manichaeans.
Cassian seems to refer to his thirteenth conference, which is about the protection of God, when he says: "For wanting to glory more in their own righteousness than in the grace of God, they are annoyed that we resist what they have asserted against the man of the highest authority among many conferences."
This conference, dedicated to Honoratus of Marseilles along with six others, is proven to have been written before the year 426, in which he was appointed bishop of Marseilles.
This occasion (as has already been suggested) prompted Saint Prosper to write this letter when Rufinus indicated that he was moved by the rumors spread by the enemies of Saint Augustine's doctrine. These rumors targeted the reputation of Prosper, a disciple of Augustine, and he wished to be freed from this doubt.

21
00:30:30,455 --> 00:32:15,719
Saint Prosper, striving to meet the just requests of his friends, elaborates on the rumors spread by the enemies of Saint Augustine's doctrine and under what pretext they dared to speak against such a great doctor.
One of the main errors of the Pelagians was the belief that God's grace was given based on the merits of men. With this principle in place, they easily revived their other doctrines. They initially taught that human nature was so sound that it could achieve good solely through free will. Since this was entirely contrary to sound doctrine and had been rejected by all Catholic teachings, they conceded that grace was necessary to begin, progress, and persevere in good. However, they understood this as God's grace merely acting as a teacher of free will, manifesting itself through exhortations, the law, teachings, contemplation of creation, miracles, and external terrors, so that anyone, according to the movement of their will, if they sought, would find, if they asked, would receive, if they knocked, would enter.
From this followed the belief that grace was given according to the merits of men, and therefore grace was no longer grace. This cunning of the children of darkness was revealed by the judgment of the Eastern bishops, the authority of the Apostolic See, and the vigilance of the African prelates. Saint Augustine, whom Saint Prosper says was then the chief portion of the Lord's priests, refuted this in his polemical writings and defeated such heresy in every way.
However, some among the Catholics in Gaul defamed his doctrine and writings with malicious rumors, claiming that he completely removed free will and preached necessity under the name of grace, and that he wanted to believe in two natures in one man.

22
00:32:15,719 --> 00:34:10,727
If that were the case, they would openly oppose and refute harmful errors with written books, not try to harm that man with secret whispers, whose teachings align with the Roman Church and the Africans, indeed with all Catholics around the world. These people are driven to such bold actions because they are upset that their opposition to Augustine's teachings in their Collations was resisted.
They know well that if they raised such matters in any gathering of priests, they would be met with hundreds of volumes from the blessed Augustine, which abundantly prove that we should not glory in anything good we have done, except in the grace of Christ the Lord, and not in the strength of free will.
However, they hope for the riches of God's mercy, as stated in his teachings, that He who allowed them to be deceived by free will and stray from the path of humility at that time, would not leave them completely deceived, nor until the end. They were wrong in this, as noted in subsequent teachings, in that they placed the beginnings of virtues and good works in natural ability; or if they said these flowed from grace, they claimed that grace was preceded by some good work or good will, and was granted as a reward for such.
Saint Prosper diligently refuted this error, proving with Scripture that after the fall, man is left with no strength to do good, nor to earn merit, without the help of preceding grace. From the destruction incurred by Adam's sin, humans can only be rescued by God's gratuitous merciful grace. He demonstrates this with the example of infants dying without baptism and those nations to which the Gospel of salvation has not yet been known to reach.
Grace does not deny free will, but establishes and reforms it. Left on its own, free will is sufficient for evil and a fall, but it needs to be healed by grace, by which one is inspired to think and act differently, and is taught to attribute their health not to themselves, but to their healer.

23
00:34:10,727 --> 00:35:07,871
Finally, Saint Prosper clears the cloud of slander against Augustine's doctrine, which falsely claimed it introduced fate or dual nature.
He argues that Augustine never wrote anything close to such errors.
Prosper teaches that neither Augustine nor his disciples attribute anything to fate, but believe everything is directed by divine providence.
They do not establish two natures—one good and one evil—but only one nature, which, though created upright, fell through the sin of the first man and became subject to eternal death.
However, this nature is to be renewed through a new creation in Christ, who saves humanity by restoring freedom and providing continuous help.
Prosper concludes his work in the Book of Numbers, Chapter 20, by urging his friend Rufinus to devote time to understanding Augustine's debates, if he truly desires to be properly instructed in the sound doctrine of God's grace, as he ought to desire.

24
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:12,527
Saint Prosper of Aquitaine's Letter to Rufinus on Grace and Free Will

25
00:35:12,527 --> 00:36:32,975
To my most beloved brother in Christ and rightly revered Rufinus, Prosper wishes eternal salvation.
I received, through a mutual friend, signs of your brotherly concern for me, and I gratefully recognized the care of your most sincere love.
To ensure that any malicious rumors, should they reach your ears, do not cause you fear or anxiety, I have taken care to address any doubts you might have through this letter.
I aim to reveal everything to you with the utmost truth so that, since you may not have heard the full extent of what our adversaries are spreading, you can learn directly from me what is being said to stir up unfounded envy.
But first, I must explain to you the nature of the issue from which these rumors arise. This way, the falsehoods of the accusers will be clearer to you, and you will see how they attempt to obscure the truth with lies.
The Pelagian heresy, with its doctrines that aim to destroy the Catholic faith, and the poisonous impiety it has tried to spread within the Church, are already well-known and do not need a detailed account.
However, one of their most wicked and subtle blasphemies is the claim that God's grace is given according to human merits.
Initially, they asserted that human nature possessed such great holiness that, through free will alone, one could attain the kingdom of God.
They argued that human nature was sufficiently supported by its own condition, having a rational intellect, to easily choose good and avoid evil.
They claimed that, where the works of the will were free in both directions, the ability to do good was not lacking in those who were evil, but the effort was.

26
00:36:32,975 --> 00:37:47,519
Since, as I mentioned, they wanted all human righteousness to rely on natural integrity and capability, and this definition was rejected by sound doctrine, they preserved this condemned view by the Catholics, later colored by many varieties of heretical deceit, with the ingenuity that they professed God's grace as necessary for starting, progressing, and persevering in good.
But in this profession, the vessels of wrath tried to sneak in deceitfully, but God's grace revealed this to the vessels of mercy. It was understood and clearly seen that they only confessed grace to the extent that it serves as a teacher to free will, showing itself through exhortations, through the law, through doctrine, through contemplation of creation, through miracles, and through external terrors to its judgment, so that each person, according to the movement of their own will, might find if they seek, receive if they ask, and enter if they knock.
For the call of grace initially acts upon us by reminding us of our own ability; and grace is no more than law, prophet, or teacher, whose common and general effort is present among all people throughout the world, so that those who wish to believe may do so, and those who believe may receive justification by the merit of their faith and good will: thus, God's grace is given according to human merit.
And in this way, grace would not be grace: because if it is given according to merits, and it is not the creator of good things itself, it is called grace in vain.

27
00:37:47,519 --> 00:39:05,567
Here are the tricks used by those who wished to transform themselves into the likeness of the righteous. These have been uncovered by the judgments of Eastern bishops, the authority of the apostolic see, and the vigilance of African councils. The most blessed Augustine, a notable figure among the Lord's priests at the time, thoroughly and eloquently dismantled these deceptions in his many writings.
Among the many gifts from God, with which the Spirit of Truth abundantly filled him, Augustine possessed profound knowledge and wisdom born from God's love. He not only eradicated this persistent heresy but also many previous ones with the invincible sword of the word. Despite the numerous victories and triumphs he achieved for the enlightenment of the Church and the glory of Christ, some individuals, regrettably, whisper against him in secret, though we are aware of it.
They criticize his writings, particularly those addressing the errors of the Pelagians, accusing him of entirely removing free will and promoting fatal necessity under the guise of grace. They further claim that he believed in two classes of humanity and two natures, attributing to him the impiety of pagans and Manicheans.
If these accusations are true, why are they so negligent, not to mention impious, that they do not repel such sudden ruin from the Church? Why do they not resist such insane preachings or at least confront him with any writings from which such doctrines emanate? Indeed, they would have greatly benefited the human race and earned their own glory if they had corrected Augustine from his supposed errors.

28
00:39:05,567 --> 00:40:26,015
Unless, perhaps, modest men and new critics generously and mercifully spare the elderly man of great past achievements, confident that no one anywhere will accept his books.
They may forgive, or rather understand, that not only the Roman and African Church, but all the children of promise throughout the world, agree with this man's teaching, just as they do with the whole faith, in the confession of grace.
But even in these very places where complaints are raised against him, there are, by God's own doing, many who benefit from his enlightening discussions on the reception of evangelical and apostolic doctrine.
They are daily growing within the body of Christ, as much as He himself multiplies them.
If we are rightly criticized, why are we not consistently rebuked?
If we are not to be rebuked, why are we secretly slandered?
But who does not know why they privately grumble out of their own resentment, and publicly remain silent in council?
They want to take pride more in their own righteousness than in the grace of God, and they are annoyed that we oppose what they assert against a man of great authority in many debates.
Nor do they doubt that if they raise any question on this matter, in any gathering of priests or congregation of people, they will encounter hundreds of volumes by the most blessed Augustine.
When these begin to reveal to the hearts of listeners the powerful truth of the Christian faith, and to flood the minds of those present from the sources of divine eloquence, who among the faithful, who among the pious, recognizing and commending the causes of their own salvation, would want to accept this bitterness of smoky vanity?

29
00:40:26,015 --> 00:42:13,847
I also hope for this from the richness of God's mercy: that those whom He now allows to be deceived by their own free will and to stray from the path of humility, He will not fully and finally deprive of understanding. Instead, He allows them to wander further so that when He finally calls them back, His grace will be celebrated with even greater glory, having subdued even the hearts of those who opposed Him.
This opposition arose from their pursuit of virtue and moral integrity, not because anyone should lack these qualities, but because their use is miserable when they are thought to arise from natural ability or from the generosity of grace with some preceding merit of good work or good will.
They indeed assert these things with certain testimonies from Holy Scripture, but they are not reasonably taken. For in the defense of any definition, one should present those which do not yield to another understanding that seems to contradict the definition, and which do not abandon the rule to which they are fitted.
Thus, they say it is spoken to those using free will: "Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart; and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (Matthew 11:28).
They want this to apply to all people laboring in the uncertainty of this life and burdened with sins, so that those who wish to imitate the gentleness and humility of the Savior and take on the yoke of His commandments may find rest for their souls in the hope of eternal life. However, those who do not wish to do this will lack salvation through their own fault; if they had wished, they could have obtained it.
But let them also hear what the Lord has said to those using free will: "Without me, you can do nothing" (John 15:5); and, "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him" (John 6:44); and, "No one can come to me unless it is granted by my Father" (John 6:65); and, "Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He will" (John 5:21).

30
00:42:13,847 --> 00:44:02,951
"No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him" (Luke 10:22). These truths are unchangeable and cannot be twisted into another meaning. Who would doubt that free will responds to the call when the grace of God has created the disposition to believe and obey in that person? Otherwise, it would be enough to warn a person without also creating a new will within them, as it is written: "The will is prepared by the Lord" (Proverbs 8:35, according to the Septuagint); and as the Apostle says: "For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure" (Philippians 2:13). What good pleasure, if not the one that God has worked in them, so that he would give both the desire and the action to accomplish it?
They also use the example of the centurion Cornelius to demonstrate the power of free will. Before receiving grace, he feared and prayed to God, and with spontaneous zeal, he was dedicated to almsgiving, fasting, and prayer (Acts 10:2). For this reason, he was praised by divine testimony and received the gift of regeneration. They do not understand that all of Cornelius's preparation was granted by God's grace (see the Synod of Orange below). When Saint Peter was taught through a vision about baptizing Cornelius, and therefore about all the Gentiles, he refused unclean and indiscriminate food due to Jewish observance. A voice came to him three times saying, "What God has made clean, you must not call common" (Acts 10:15). This clearly shows that all the good works that came before in Cornelius were initiated by God's grace for his purification: so that the Apostle would not hesitate to confer the sacrament to someone whom the Lord had already given this gift, lest the beginning of the new and still unrevealed calling would waver, unless it was confirmed by the very signs of previous efforts showing that God had been at work in those chosen. For not everyone has faith (Second Thessalonians 3:2); nor does everyone believe the Gospel (Romans 10:16).

31
00:44:02,951 --> 00:45:56,927
Those who believe are led by the Spirit of God, while those who do not believe turn away by their own free will. Therefore, our conversion to God is not from us, but from God. As the Apostle says,
"By grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; not by works, so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2:8).
Let human weakness acknowledge itself, and recognize the condemned succession in the first man of all generations. When the dead are brought to life, the blind are given sight, and the ungodly are justified, let them confess their life, light, and righteousness in Jesus Christ. Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord (1 Corinthians 1:31), not in himself. While he was ungodly, blind, and dead, he received righteousness, light, and life freely from his deliverer.
He did not act justly and then his righteousness increased, nor did he walk towards God and then his journey was confirmed. He did not love God and then his love was inflamed; but while he was without faith, and therefore ungodly, he received the Spirit of faith and was made righteous.
"The righteous shall live by faith" (Romans 1:17);
and,
"Without faith it is impossible to please God" (Hebrews 11:6);
and,
"Everything that does not come from faith is sin" (Romans 14:23);
so that it may be understood that the righteousness of unbelievers is not righteousness because nature without grace is tainted.
Indeed, having lost natural innocence, man, exiled and lost, walked without a path and entered deeper errors. But he was sought, found, brought back, and introduced into the path which is truth and life. He was ignited with love for God, who first loved him when he did not love Him. As the blessed Apostle John says,
"Not that we loved God, but that He loved us" (1 John 4:10);
and again,
"We love because God first loved us" (1 John 4:19);
and he also says,
"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love" (1 John 4:7-8).

32
00:45:56,927 --> 00:47:35,279
As blessed Paul says, In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love.
Galatians chapter 5, verse 6
Where does this faith connected to charity come from? Paul himself shows it is received by saying, Because it has been granted to you for Christ, not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him.
Philippians chapter 1, verse 29
This certainly could not happen without great charity.
And again, The love of God has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
Romans chapter 5, verse 5
Without this charity, the Apostle testifies that no matter how much faith, knowledge, virtues, zeal, or labor one has, it is of no benefit.
First Corinthians chapter 13
Many praiseworthy and admirable things can be found in a person, but without the core of charity, they have the appearance of piety but lack the truth.
In this great and ineffable good, no one was found worthy, but whoever was chosen by God was made worthy:
as the Apostle says, Giving thanks to the Father, who has made us worthy to share in the inheritance of the saints in light, who has delivered us from the power of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of the Son of his love.
Colossians chapter 1, verse 3
And to Timothy: Share in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God, who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began.
Second Timothy chapter 1, verse 8
And to Titus: For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.
But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy.
Titus chapter 3, verse 3

33
00:47:35,279 --> 00:49:08,519
The grace of God justifies anyone, not by making good people better, but by making bad people good. Then, through growth, it makes good people better. It doesn't take away free will, but frees it. When free will is without God, it is dead to righteousness and alive to sin. But when the mercy of Christ illuminates it, it is rescued from the kingdom of the devil and becomes the kingdom of God. To stay in this kingdom, our own ability isn't enough; we need perseverance from the same source that gave us diligence.
Even the most ardent faith of Saint Peter would have failed in temptations if the Lord had not prayed for him.
The Evangelist reveals this in Luke 22:31-32:
"Jesus said to Peter, 'Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to sift you like wheat. But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And you, when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers. And pray that you may not enter into temptation'" (Luke 22:40).
This further proves that free will can do nothing without grace. To whom was it said, "Strengthen your brothers, and pray that you may not enter into temptation"?
It was said to the one who responded from free will, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death" (Luke 22:33).
The same person is predicted to deny the Lord three times before the rooster crows.
What else could this mean but that he would fail in faith?
Surely the Lord had prayed for him that his faith would not fail.
And certainly, He had not prayed in vain, as His work was one with that of the one He prayed to.
But to show that the one who promised great things about himself did not stand by his own free will, he was allowed to falter.
This was so that He who looked at and restored the troubled and failing one, without whom no one stands or perseveres, might strengthen him.

34
00:49:08,519 --> 00:50:44,831
But some people reject the grace of God because if they acknowledged it as proclaimed in divine scripture and recognized by the power of their own actions, they would also have to admit that out of all the people born through all ages, there is a specific, defined number predestined for eternal life, chosen by God's calling according to His purpose. Denying this is as impious as opposing grace itself.
It is evident from common observation how throughout countless ages, innumerable thousands of people, lost in their errors and impieties, have perished without any knowledge of the true God. This is also declared in the Acts of the Apostles, where Paul and Barnabas say to the Lycaonians:
"Men, why are you doing these things? We are also mortal, humans like you, proclaiming to you that you should turn from these useless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them; who in past generations allowed all nations to walk in their own ways.
Nevertheless, He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good, giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."
If natural intelligence or the use of God's benefits could suffice for them to attain eternal life, then rational contemplation, the temperate climate, and the abundance of fruits and foods would save us as well in our time. By naturally using these things better, we would worship our Creator for His daily gifts.
But let this overly foolish and dangerous belief be far from the souls of the pious and those redeemed by Christ's blood. Human nature is not liberated except through one mediator between God and humans, the man Christ Jesus (First Timothy 2:5); without Him, nobody is saved (Acts 4:12). Just as He made us, and not we ourselves (Psalm 100:3), so He also renews us, and not we ourselves.

35
00:50:44,831 --> 00:52:30,359
So that the ability of man to repay the price of this restoration through works of justice would not seem to be credited to himself, the riches of God's goodness were given to some infants from the very beginning. In them, neither preceding nor succeeding devotion is chosen; there is no obedience, no discretion, no will. I am speaking of those who are reborn as soon as they are born and taken from this life to eternal happiness. Meanwhile, an innumerable multitude of infants of the same nature and condition die without regeneration. About these, it is clear that they do not have a part in the city of God.
And where is that which is always opposed to us by those who do not understand, that God wants all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth?
As it is written in First Timothy chapter two, verse four, "God wants all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth."
Are there not among all men those who have perished without the knowledge of God from past generations up to now? And if for the older ones—which is not rightly said—the evil deeds they committed by free will were harmful, as if the good were not freed by grace but the evil. What distinction of merits could there be between saved infants and not saved infants? What brought these into the kingdom of God? What excluded these from the kingdom of God? Indeed, if you consider merit, neither part deserved to be saved, but both to be condemned. Because for all being fallen in Adam's transgression, unless merciful grace took up some, unblamed justice would remain over all.
But what is the cause or reason of this discretion in the secret counsel of God is beyond the capacity of human knowledge to inquire, and it is unknown without diminishing faith. Let us confess that no one is lost undeservedly, no one is freed deservedly, and the most omnipotent goodness of the Lord wants to save all and to imbue all with the knowledge of the truth, whom He wills to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For unless He calls, teaches, saves, no one comes, no one is instructed, no one is saved.

36
00:52:30,359 --> 00:54:17,687
Because even though teachers are commanded to preach to all people without distinction and to spread the seed of the word everywhere, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. First Corinthians chapter three, verse seven.
When the apostles began to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles, Scripture recalls about some of those who heard, saying, "When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed." Acts chapter thirteen, verse forty-eight.
And elsewhere, when many women were listening to Paul teaching, it says, "A woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God, heard us; the Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message." Acts chapter sixteen, verse fourteen.
At the very time when the preaching of the Gospel was being sent to all nations, the apostles were forbidden to go to certain places by Him who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. Certainly, many in that delay and turning away from the Gospel would die without the knowledge of the truth and without the consecration of regeneration. Therefore, let Scripture tell what happened: "Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia. When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to." Acts chapter sixteen, verses six to seven.
What wonder is it, then, if at the very beginning of the evangelical preaching, the apostles could only go where the Spirit of God wanted them to go; when we see that many nations are only now beginning to become participants in the grace of Christ, while others have not yet received any scent of this good?
Or should we say that human wills oppose the will of God, and that the customs of these people are so fierce and unmanageable that they do not hear the Gospel because their impious hearts are not open to the preaching? And who changed their hearts, if not the one who formed their hearts individually? Psalm chapter thirty-three, verse fifteen.

37
00:54:17,687 --> 00:56:07,055
Who softened the harshness of this severity to a feeling of obedience, except the one who can raise children for Abraham from stones?
Matthew 3:9
And who gave the preachers fearless and unscathed steadfastness, except the one who said to Paul,
“Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not be silent; for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city”?
Acts 18:9
I also think that no one would dare to say that any nation of the world, any region of the earth, should be excluded from the spreading of the Church's tents, as God says to the Son,
“Ask of me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, and the ends of the earth as your possession.”
Psalm 2:8
And again, “All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations shall worship before him.”
Psalm 22:28
The Lord himself also says,
“This Gospel will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.”
Matthew 24:14
Therefore, whatever nations have not yet heard will hear the Gospel, and as many as are appointed to eternal life will believe.
Acts 13:48
For no others will come into the inheritance of Christ than those who were chosen before the foundation of the world, and predestined and foreknown, according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will.
Ephesians 1:11
Therefore, let us acknowledge the works of the Lord, and glorify his mercies, and not impatiently bear the fact that we do not know what or how many vessels of election there are.
Because even in earlier ages, when it was said of the people of one nation,
“God is known in Judah; his name is great in Israel.”
Psalm 76:2
The future election of the nations was hidden; and later it became known what had not been revealed before: as the Apostle says,
“Which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus.”
Ephesians 3:5-6

38
00:56:07,055 --> 00:57:47,471
And in the Acts of the Apostles, it says, "The believers from the circumcision who had come with Peter were astounded because the grace of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles" (Acts 10:45).
If the Lord chose to hide and delay His plan of calling for as long as He wanted, and revealed it when He wanted, and this ignorance did no harm to His saints, then why do we think it would harm our hope if the number and identity of the people prepared as vessels of mercy for glory are hidden?
It is clear that the kingdom of heaven will be entered by all the good, thanks to the grace of God, and will not be entered by any of the evil, due to their own wickedness.
It is very foolish and inconsiderate for opponents to say that through this grace of God, nothing is left to free will. Even though infants passing through baptism obviously have no work or desire of their will, and many who indeed use free will but turn away from the true God and lead lives in sin are sanctified by the liberating regeneration at the very end of their breath, yet if we consider with a pious gaze that part of the children of God reserved for works of piety, do we not find in them free will, not destroyed but reborn?
When left to itself, free will moved only to its own ruin. It had blinded itself, and it could not enlighten itself. Now, however, the same will is turned, not overturned, and it is given the ability to will differently, to perceive differently, to act differently, and to place its well-being not in itself but in the healer; because it does not yet have perfect health that makes it immune to harm, or the strength to restrain itself from unhealthy influences on its own.
Therefore, the man who was bad in free will became good in the same free will; but he was bad by himself, good by God; who reformed him into that initial honor with a different beginning, so that He did not only forgive him the guilt of evil will and action, but also granted him the ability to will well, to act well, and to remain in these things.

39
00:57:47,471 --> 00:59:29,663
For every perfect gift, says the apostle James, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights (James 1:17). He clearly shows what free will is like when controlled by the human spirit and what it is like when governed by God, saying, "But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth. This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic. For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy" (James 3:14). Therefore, whoever studies and clings to these virtues is enlightened not by their own wisdom but by the wisdom from above: "For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding" (Proverbs 1:6). And this is their truest glory, if they boast not in themselves, but in the Lord.
However, the things that are said about fate and the two masses and two natures, with the most foolish falsehood, in injury to such a great man, neither burden him, in whose books such errors are most copiously destroyed, nor do they disturb us, who detest such opinions along with their authors. See Augustine, Book II, against Two Letters of the Pelagians, chapters 6 and 7, and Book IV against Julian, chapter 8, in the appendix, part II. But let those who can fabricate such nonsense see how they remove themselves from the disgrace of this falsehood, if those whose ears they abuse apply a little diligence to understand what the most excellent minister of grace has argued. Though those who speak these things ought to anticipate every delay of such an investigation by bringing forth and explaining the books, or at least demonstrating some part of them, by which such a holy man would have published anything liable to such an interpretation, even if only through doubtful understanding.

40
00:59:29,663 --> 01:01:02,399
But they have heard nothing of the sort from us, nor have they read anything of the sort: because we know that nothing happens by fate, but everything is arranged by God's judgment. We know that the nature of all humans was created and continues to be created from one source, which is the flesh of the first man, not from two sources or two natures. That same nature was brought down by the free will of the first man, in whom all sinned. As stated in Romans chapter five, verse twelve, "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned." This nature is in no way free from the debt of eternal death unless it is reformed by the grace of the second creation of Christ, preserved through His free will by acting, aspiring, assisting, and leading the way until the end.
Hence, because your holiness perceives (if, however, the obscurity of my speech does not hinder it) that it is in vain for some to complain about us, and that all those foolish accusations to irritate and turn away the minds of those whom they wish to persuade otherwise have been concocted: therefore, trust in the power of God's mercy. This contradiction will rest, as in other parts of the world, so also in these regions: so that the preaching of the highest man in the Church at this time may also be helped by those who currently reject it. But you, my most beloved and venerable brother, if you truly desire to be instructed on these questions, as it is fitting for you to desire, dedicate your care to knowing the disputations of the blessed Augustine. In confessing the grace of God, you may attain the purest and most wholesome understanding of the evangelical and apostolic doctrine. May the grace of God and the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ keep you at all times, and guide you along the path of truth to eternal life.
