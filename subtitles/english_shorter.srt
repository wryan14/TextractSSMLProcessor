00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,727
Letter to His Relative Valerian on the Contempt of the World and Secular Philosophy
by Eucherius of Lyons

2
00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:10,377
Those who are bound by love are also united by blood.

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:16,374
So, it is fitting for us to take great pride in this gift from God, that we are connected by both affection and kinship.

4
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:21,573
Two relationships unite us into one feeling: one from our fleshly parents, the other we chose ourselves.

5
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:33,018
This dual bond of lineage and love has compelled me to write to you at length, to commend to your mind the cause of your soul, and to assert the true happiness and capacity for eternal things, which is the work of our profession.

6
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:38,966
Since I love you as much as myself, it is necessary for me to desire the highest good for you, just as I do for myself.

7
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:47,113
Indeed, you are not averse to the profession of a holy life, having a devout nature that has anticipated many teachings of sacred institutions with early maturity.

8
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:54,311
You seem to have embraced certain duties of religion almost by providential nature, already with the indulgence of our Lord and God towards you.

9
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:57,859
By His grace, divine teaching can find and contribute some good in you.

10
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:07,056
Although you have been elevated to the highest peaks of the world by your father and father-in-law, surrounded by illustrious titles from both, I long for a far superior honor for you.

11
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:12,054
I call you not to earthly, but to heavenly dignity; not to the dignity of this age, but of the ages.

12
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:15,153
For this glory is certain and indelible, to glory in eternity.

13
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:22,751
Therefore, I will speak to you not of the wisdom of this age, but of that hidden and secret wisdom, which God predestined before the ages for our glory.

14
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:23,750
First Corinthians 2.

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:30,598
I will speak to you with great effort, caring little for myself, considering more what I wish for you than what I can achieve for myself.

16
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:43,658
This is the first duty of a person who has been created and brought into the light, my dearest Valerian: to know their Creator, and having known Him, to embrace Him; and to dedicate their life, which is a divine gift, to divine service and worship.

17
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:52,265
So that what they received as a gift from God, they may complete with devotion to God, and what they unworthily received from Him, they may offer back to Him in submission.

18
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:56,769
We are guided by a sound belief that since we were brought forth by Him, we belong to Him.

19
00:01:56,769 --> 00:02:05,326
Therefore, whoever understands this clearly and magnificently perceives the intention of our Creator in forming humans, knows that both we and He were made for each other.

20
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:11,081
It is then best to give primary care to the soul, so that what is more important in benefit is not less considered.

21
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:19,138
The primary concerns should take the first place in our lives, and the highest parts of our worries should be claimed by salvation, which is the highest concern.

22
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:23,842
This should occupy us for its own protection and guardianship, not just primarily, but solely.

23
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:26,994
It should surpass everything with the effort that precedes all.

24
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:35,902
We owe the highest observance to God, and the greatest to the soul; and yet, this is so that, since both are paramount, it appears that neither can be observed without the other.

25
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:44,559
Thus, whoever satisfies God must necessarily have already taken care of the soul; and conversely, whoever takes care of the soul must necessarily have already satisfied God.

26
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:58,220
In this way, the matter concerning both the highest and most beneficial in us is resolved in a forced yet beneficial summary; so that if someone diligently fulfills one, they achieve both, because by the ineffable divine kindness, utility itself becomes a sacrifice to God.

27
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,474
Much effort is spent on bodily treatments; much work is given to the hope of healing.

28
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,225
Does the soul not deserve medicine?

29
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:14,684
And if various aids are applied to the body in the pursuit of health, it is not right for the soul to be left lying as if excluded and neglected, wasting away in its diseases, and exiled from its own remedies.

30
00:03:14,684 --> 00:03:18,537
Indeed, more should be provided for the soul if so much is given to the body.

31
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:27,545
For, if some have rightly said that the flesh is a servant and the soul a master; it is not fitting for us to place the master in a lesser position and unjustly prefer the servant.

32
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:33,821
Deservingly, a better part of us seeks higher pursuits, as we should aim for the greater dignity of our being.

33
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:38,040
It is not fitting, in this noble endeavor, to subject ourselves to something lesser.

34
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,661
The flesh, inclined towards vice, pulls us back to the earth, as if to its origin Genesis 8.

35
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:47,734
But the spirit, coming from the Father of lights, strives for higher things, like iron drawn to fire.

36
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:51,753
This is the image of God within us, this is the precious pledge of divine grace.

37
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:57,830
We must protect it with all our strength; if we govern and preserve it, we are safeguarding God's trust Second Timothy 1.

38
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,392
Who can build without first laying the foundations?

39
00:04:00,392 --> 00:04:03,908
For anyone seeking to build other benefits, health is the cornerstone.

40
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:07,072
But how can one add to these without first securing the basics?

41
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:10,789
How will the growth of what follows increase if the foundation is lacking?

42
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:14,506
How can one think they are attaining happiness when they lack even health?

43
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:17,219
How can someone who lacks life abound in a happy life?

44
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:20,835
And what good is it to add food if there is nothing to nourish the soul?

45
00:04:20,835 --> 00:05:00,115
About this, our Lord Jesus Christ said: "What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?" Matthew 16.
Therefore, no profit can exist if it means the loss of the soul. Where there is a loss of health, there certainly is no gain; for how can gain be found if the foundation for holding it is not secure? And so, towards that true profit, that holy and desirable exchange, while there is still time, let us hurry Galatians 6.
A few days can produce eternal life; but even if these days held the untouched and unstained happiness of life, because they are few, they would be considered of little value. For nothing is truly great if it is short-lived; nor is joy lasting if it ends quickly. The fleeting usefulness of this world offers only brief comforts.

46
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:05,451
Therefore, it seems right to prefer the benefit of eternal life over the good of a short life.

47
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:09,984
Eternal happiness is everlasting, while the joys of a short life are temporary and fragile.

48
00:05:09,984 --> 00:05:11,479
Eternal life is truly blessed.

49
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,472
What could be happier than eternal life?

50
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:16,062
In contrast, this short life is filled with burdens.

51
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:20,895
It is pressed from all sides by troubles, wearied by evils, and tossed by the injuries of events.

52
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:23,535
This life is untrustworthy, variable, and calamitous.

53
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:25,976
It is full of labor, anxiety, cares, and dangers.

54
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:31,805
It becomes restless with bodily afflictions, anxious with mental anguish, and uncertain in the whirlwinds of dangers.

55
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:36,489
What reason is there not to desire eternal goods and instead follow temporary, even bad, ones?

56
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:41,172
In this life, a prudent person invests generously in a place where they expect to stay longer.

57
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:46,453
Where they expect to be for a short time, they provide little; where for a longer time, they provide more.

58
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:56,965
Likewise, because the present time is very short and constrained by narrow limits, and the future holds ages, let us enrich eternal life with appropriate abundance and equip the short life with what is suitable.

59
00:05:56,965 --> 00:06:01,698
We should not give the greatest care to the short time and the least care to the greatest time.

60
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:11,861
It's hard to say what should compel us more quickly or effectively to this most blessed life: the benefits of the future life that are promised or the inconveniences of the present life that are apparent.

61
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:16,594
The future benefits entice us sweetly, while the present inconveniences strongly drive us away.

62
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:19,085
Even the worst things can support the better part.

63
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:22,174
If we are not attracted by the good, we are pushed by the bad.

64
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:27,853
To encourage better things, the best harmonize with the worst, and different things converge for the same benefit.

65
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:31,789
While some things invite us, others repel us, both urging us toward the better.

66
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:41,668
If a famous and wealthy person were to summon you to adopt you as their child, you would go through all sorts of difficulties and travel great distances to reach them, wouldn’t you?

67
00:06:41,668 --> 00:08:25,894
God, the Lord of the universe and all things, calls you to adoption, offering you the sweet name of "child" if you are willing, the same name He calls His only Son.
First Corinthians chapter 8, Galatians chapter 4, Ephesians chapter 1.
And yet, you are not moved or urged to hurry, lest death snatches away this great opportunity with its swift arrival?
And to obtain this, you won't venture through desolate lands or the uncertain seas of far distances?
Whenever you want, this adoption is with you.
Will this matter make us sluggish and lazy because it is as accessible as it is great?
The more reluctant will experience this condition more harshly.
For it is more harmful to those who are unwilling, the easier it is for those who are willing.
Certainly, it is the desire for life that has tied us to the enjoyment of the present reality.
So, those who love life, we urge you to life.
It is reasonable to persuade when we ask you to obtain what you desire.
For the life you love, we act as ambassadors to you.
Second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 20.
Ephesians chapter 6 verse 20.
And we suggest that you love the eternal life, which you all love in a small measure, so that you may love it more.
How can we love it, I wonder, if we don't desire this life to be as beautiful as possible?
Therefore, that which pleases even when it is brief should please more if it can be eternal; and that which has value to us, even though it has an end, should be beyond value to us if it can be endless.
It is right, then, to consider lesser life in view of greater life, so that we may build a passage to the latter through the former: a plan that should not be hindered by the dubious benefits of the associated one.
It should not oppose itself to the extent that it harms.
It is indeed absurd and contradictory for the love of life to bring harm to life.
Therefore, whether you think this life should be despised or embraced, my argument is easy in either case.
For if it is despised, there is one reason for doing so, which is to seek a better one.
And if it is loved, then the greater life should be loved all the more.

68
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,841
However, I want you to see this as an experiment itself.

69
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:34,376
Acknowledge that it's extremely troublesome and filled with uncertain exhaustion, and judge it accordingly.

70
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:37,221
Reject it along with its preoccupations and dismiss it.

71
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:43,636
Let the endless chain of worldly affairs be broken, and let that single labor for many necessities throughout life be ended.

72
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:50,155
Let's break the bonds of futile concerns, whose succeeding links entangle us, making our occupation always seem to begin anew.

73
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:57,087
Remove those empty but intertwined causes, in which, as long as we live, human endeavor never finishes, constantly starting new tasks.

74
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:02,778
The tireless focus on these things has already made our inherently short and narrow life even more restricted.

75
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:06,917
From these come vain joys, bitter sorrows, anxious wishes, and suspicious fears.

76
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:12,452
Finally, let us discard everything that makes this present life short due to busyness and long due to pain.

77
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:16,694
Let us reject the life of this untrustworthy world, which is suspect in every way.

78
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:19,385
In this world, both high and low are equally unsafe.

79
00:09:19,385 --> 00:09:23,368
The lowly are trampled by humiliation, and the high sway in their prominence.

80
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:31,283
Whatever position you choose, there is no rest in either the lowest or the highest states: both conditions cannot escape the heavy fate of the whirlwind.

81
00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:34,129
The lesser is subjected to insult, the greater to envy.

82
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:42,561
Two main things, I believe, hold people bound in the affairs of the world and captivated by its seductive allure: the pleasure of wealth and the dignity of honors.

83
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:47,631
Of these, the former should be called not pleasure, but need; the latter, not dignity, but vanity.

84
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:53,115
Both of these, entangling us in alternating knots, hinder our steps, deceptively embracing our fellowship.

85
00:09:53,115 --> 00:10:00,099
They insidiously inspire vices into human hearts with their enticing desires and solicit the weary minds of mortals with easy pleasure.

86
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:05,686
For what is more pernicious than riches, to speak of them first, which are rarely amassed without injustice?

87
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:10,187
Such a resource is achieved with such an administrator, preserved with such a guardian.

88
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:13,446
For the love of money, says Scripture, is the root of all evil.

89
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,257
(First Timothy chapter 6, verse 10)

90
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:20,949
There is almost a kind of partnership, even in name, between these two things: vices and riches.

91
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:22,867
Aren't those riches a source of insults?

92
00:10:22,867 --> 00:12:07,152
As one of our own has said:
"What else are riches but pledges of injustice?"
Don't they, like rewards placed before the wicked, provoke the eyes and minds of troublemakers, practically displaying and inviting their own confiscation?
But suppose that does not happen. Can we be sure where they will go after us, who will wander and flee?
"He stores up wealth and does not know who will gather it"
Psalm
38:7.
But suppose the heir comes as desired. Doesn't the heir often squander the wealth, and the accumulated riches are wasted by either a poorly raised son or an ill-chosen son-in-law?
What pleasure do these riches have in themselves, whose possession is miserable and transmission uncertain? Where, misled and headlong, are you taking the love of men?
You know how to love the things that come to you, but you don't know how to love yourself?
What you love is outside; what you desire is outside yourself. Rather, return to yourself, so that you may be dearer to yourself than your possessions.
Indeed, if someone well-versed in matters were to approach you, wouldn't you prefer that he love you yourself rather than those things that are with you? And you would choose that he direct his affection more towards your life than your wealth. You want to be faithful to a person, not to things. What you would want another to give to you, you, who are your own most faithful friend, should give to yourself. Let us love ourselves rather than our possessions.
And these things have been said against wealth. As for the honors of this world, to remain silent on other matters, what dignity can there be in things when the wicked rise to these positions just as ambitiously as the good, and a single honor does not encompass men of a single merit, and dignity no longer distinguishes between the worthy and the unworthy, but confounds them?
Thus, what should have preferred the better to the worse has begun to equalize them: and in a new way, there is almost nowhere less distinction between the best and the worst men than in honor. Isn't it a greater honor to prefer to be without such dishonorable honors, and to be valued more for one's own morals than for shared honors?

93
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:11,340
And these very things—whatever they may be—how fleeting and temporary they are.

94
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,194
Recently, we saw men distinguished by honor, sitting in lofty positions, spreading their wealth across the world.

95
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:21,649
Their successes surpassed their desires, and their achievements exceeded their wishes.

96
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:23,462
But I only recall private fortunes.

97
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:26,260
Even kings, exalted by great power, shone with jewels.

98
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,870
Their garments glittered, their crowns sparkled with interwoven metals and adorned trees.

99
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:35,533
Their palaces gleamed with royal splendor, and their ceilings glimmered with gilded beams.

100
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:39,004
Their wills were the laws of men, their words were called statutes.

101
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:41,594
Who can rise above the transient happiness of man?

102
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:48,328
Behold, their grand ambitions are gone, their abundant riches have vanished, and the very masters of such wealth have passed away.

103
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:52,680
As it is written in the book of Job chapter 14, and in the book of Wisdom chapter 5.

104
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,565
Some of the most recent and renowned kingdoms are now merely stories to us.

105
00:12:56,565 --> 00:12:59,622
All those things that were once great here are now nothing.

106
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:08,584
Nothing, as I think, or rather, as I certainly know, did they take with them from those riches, honors, and kingdoms, except—if there was any—the essence of faith and piety.

107
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:11,070
This alone follows them, devoid of other things.

108
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,111
This alone accompanies them faithfully as if it were an inseparable companion.

109
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:19,981
They are now nourished by that help, now rest in those riches, now find peace in those honors.

110
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:22,001
These are the rewards they now possess.

111
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:27,233
Therefore, if we are captivated by honors and riches, let us be moved by true riches and true honors.

112
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:32,258
The best of us transfer earthly honors and earthly riches to heavenly honors and heavenly riches.

113
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:43,137
Certainly, to that place where there is a clear and undisturbed distinction between good and evil: where, what we once obtain, we always hold: where, if there is a place for obtaining, there is none for losing.

114
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:50,131
But since we have spoken about the fragile possession of temporary goods, we must also mention the condition of this brief life itself.

115
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:51,892
What is this, I ask, what is this?

116
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:56,192
Nothing do men see daily as much as death: nothing do they forget as much as death.

117
00:13:57,383 --> 00:14:02,211
Humanity is swiftly heading towards its demise, and every generation follows this unavoidable law.

118
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:06,300
Our ancestors have passed away; we will depart, and future generations will follow.

119
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,178
Just like waves crashing on the shore, one after another, ages are broken by the boundary of death.

120
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:15,612
This thought should echo in our minds day and night, reminding us of our mortal condition.

121
00:14:15,612 --> 00:14:20,735
We must consider that the end of life is always approaching; the more it is delayed, the closer it gets.

122
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:24,332
We should expect the day to be near, for we do not know if it is far off.

123
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:27,780
Let us prepare ourselves for the end, as it is written in Malachi 3:1.

124
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,214
If we think about these things and meditate on them, we will not fear death by fearing it.

125
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:34,677
Blessed are those who have reconciled with Christ.

126
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:40,293
There is little fear of death for those who wish to be released and to be with Christ, as stated in Philippians 1.

127
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:48,915
Those who are ready and at peace, awaiting the end of their life in silence, will not be much affected by the timing of their temporary end as they transition to eternal life.

128
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:55,319
Let us not be swayed by the negligence of others in life, nor be led astray by their errors to the detriment of our own salvation.

129
00:14:55,319 --> 00:15:03,399
What good will the multitude do us in God's judgment, where each will be judged individually and only personal merit and actions will absolve anyone, not the crowd?

130
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,877
Let misleading comforts cease.

131
00:15:04,877 --> 00:15:08,966
Surely it is better to have lived with the few than to have perished with the many.

132
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:12,661
Therefore, let not the number of sinners lead us to negligence in our sins.

133
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:16,750
Let the fact that others care little for themselves not become an authority for us.

134
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,592
I implore you, always regard another's sin as a disgrace, never as an example.

135
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:25,420
If you must look at examples, look to those who, though they may be fewer, are abundant in virtue.

136
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,839
Look to those who wisely understand why they were born and, while they live, pursue the purpose of their life.

137
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:37,599
Those who are distinguished by useful deeds and outstanding virtue enhance the present life and sow for the future.

138
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:41,802
There are not only abundant examples of these, but also great ones are not lacking.

139
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:48,993
What nobility, honors, dignity, wisdom, eloquence, and literature have not already devoted themselves to the service of this heavenly kingdom?

140
00:15:48,993 --> 00:15:53,449
What high position has not already submitted to this light heavenly yoke with surrender?

141
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:58,513
Indeed, it is above all error and ignorance for anyone to neglect the matter of their own salvation.

142
00:15:58,513 --> 00:16:09,197
If it were not too lengthy, I could recount by name many illustrious men who have followed this stricter observance of divine worship and life: whose examples, lest I omit them all, I will briefly mention a few.

143
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:23,629
Clemens, from an ancient lineage of senators and even from the line of Caesars, filled with all knowledge and highly skilled in all liberal arts, transitioned to this righteous path; and he flourished so excellently in it that he also became the successor of the chief of the apostles.

144
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:40,137
Gregory from Pontus, a priest, outstanding in philosophy and eloquence in the world; but later greater and more outstanding in virtues, so much so that, as the faithful accounts of our histories tell, among other remarkable signs of merit, it is said that by his prayers and orations, a mountain withdrew, and a lake dried up.

145
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:45,758
Another saint, also named Gregory, equally devoted to letters and philosophy, desired this heavenly philosophy.

146
00:16:45,758 --> 00:17:07,128
It should not be omitted, as it pertains to the matter, that he, while still engaged in secular studies, entered the lecture hall of Basil, who was still devoted to the profession of rhetoric, and, taking him by the hand, led him out of the school, saying: "Leave these things and apply yourself to salvation." Later, both memorable priests left behind in the books of our Church the illustrious monuments of their genius.

147
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:13,819
Paulinus, the bishop of Nola, a unique and blessed example for our Gaul, once had immense wealth and abundant eloquence.

148
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:20,107
He embraced our perspective and purpose so fully that he spread his eloquence and deeds to almost all parts of the world.

149
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:29,617
Recently, Hilary and now in Italy, the bishop Petronius, both from the highest seats of worldly power, have risen—one in the name of religion, the other in the name of the priesthood.

150
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:36,788
And when will I recount the most renowned eloquent men like Firmianus, Minucius, Cyprian, Hilary, John, and Ambrose from that vast number?

151
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:44,063
They, I believe, said to themselves what one of us said, stirring themselves to this more blessed life from the secular world:
What is this?

152
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:49,571
The unlearned rise and seize heaven, and here we are, with all our theories, wallowing in flesh and blood.

153
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:50,662
(Matthew chapter 11).

154
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:51,442
They said this?

155
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:54,196
And so, they later forced their way into the kingdom.

156
00:17:54,196 --> 00:18:04,017
Having mentioned a few of those whose great fervor for our faith existed, who had experienced worldly philosophy, eloquence, and honors, I will now turn to kings and that head of the world.

157
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:15,917
I will not now recall all those ancient men devoted to religion and royal dignity; only the remarkable ones, David for his piety, Josiah for his faith, Hezekiah for his humility, will be drawn from the venerable annals of memory.

158
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:31,091
Some also from more recent times, even in our own age, have become leaders who have drawn closer to the recognition of the true king, and with utmost contrition of heart, have confessed the supreme Lord of lords; both sexes from the court have shown attentive reverence to the divine majesty.

159
00:18:31,091 --> 00:18:38,574
These, I think, should be proposed as worthy examples to emulate, whose examples provide salvation for the future and authority for the present.

160
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:47,564
You see how even days and years, and all these ornaments of the sky, preserve God's word and command with tireless observance, and keep his precepts with unwavering service.

161
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:57,963
Are we, for whom these things have been made, for whose eyes they have been given, knowledgeable of heavenly commands and not ignorant of divine will, going to ignore God's command with deaf ears?

162
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:13,044
Indeed, once it was commanded to these aids of the world what they should observe through the ages; but for us, the commands of divine law are reiterated in so many volumes, so that at least, as it is attributed to man himself, he may learn to obey the will of the Creator and attend to His commandments.

163
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:16,467
Because all of this, while it provides service, also sets an example.

164
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:21,081
And yet, if some do not want to return to their Creator, can they therefore avoid their Lord?

165
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:23,958
Or where can they escape to, those who turn away from God?

166
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:42,561
Let them listen to you, holy David, let them hear you saying:
"Where can I go from your Spirit, and where can I flee from your presence? If I ascend to heaven, you are there; if I descend to hell, you are there; if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me" (Psalm 139).

167
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:50,152
Therefore, whether they want to or not, they belong to the Lord of the universe, and if they take themselves away by will, they do not withdraw by right.

168
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:53,475
They are indeed absent in affection, but He is present in dominion.

169
00:19:53,475 --> 00:20:00,073
So, what is unwise and most thoughtless, the wandering ones live closed off from the consideration of the Lord, but within His power.

170
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:15,601
And if anyone pursues a fleeing servant with threatening pursuit, and as the enforcer of his right follows the one evading him, why does he not return his own right to the heavenly Lord, and as soon as possible, offer himself in voluntary servitude to His service, being just both to himself and to his own judge?

171
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,528
Why are we fixed on the delightful sight of present things?

172
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:20,463
Why do we dwell so much on what we see?

173
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:23,935
Do we live only by these eyes, or do we carry our eyes solely for use?

174
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,862
We also live by ears, so that we can be eager for promises.

175
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:29,988
Great affections draw us through this part of the body as well.

176
00:20:29,988 --> 00:20:35,147
Let us eagerly await with fervent vows and pressing desires those things that are promised and preached.

177
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:38,024
The faithful one, that author, instills faith in promises.

178
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:40,604
Let us strive for the best things that are promised.

179
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:46,456
If we aim to use our eyes effectively and beneficially, we are often driven by a desire for the future.

180
00:20:46,456 --> 00:21:04,253
When we turn our admiration from observing the world back toward the creator of such a grand design, or when we reflect on how much greater the light's splendor will be when it meets our eyes in the future, given the current magnificence of the light:
How much more magnificent will the form of eternal things shine, when even perishable things are so beautiful now.

181
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:11,157
Therefore, we should not misuse our bodily functions for lesser purposes but rather balance them well for both our physical and eternal lives.

182
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:14,901
Use what is temporary in a way that we do not neglect service to the eternal.

183
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:20,931
If this distraction and love please us, and if the delight of sensation draws us, this love truly is the height of pleasure.

184
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:28,711
It is not only something that can be immensely loved but also something that should be loved the most, as it is pleasant, splendid, unique, and an eternal good.

185
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:34,594
God, our God, whom you can burn for with such a great and pious fire, if precious desires follow in place of former ones.

186
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:38,971
If the dignity of such magnificence captivates you, nothing is more magnificent than that.

187
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:43,639
If something adapted to glory and fitting for it seizes you, nothing is more glorious than that.

188
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:47,869
If you are led by the sight of splendid, shining things, nothing is brighter than that.

189
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:51,613
If you are drawn by the sight of beauty, nothing is more beautiful than that.

190
00:21:51,613 --> 00:21:55,114
If you think you embrace truth in something, nothing is truer than that.

191
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:59,101
If you believe in the generosity of something, nothing is more generous than that.

192
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:01,095
Do you marvel at what is pure and simple?

193
00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:03,186
Nothing is more sincere than that goodness.

194
00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:05,763
Are you attracted by the abundance of flowing things?

195
00:22:05,763 --> 00:22:08,000
Nothing is more plentiful than that abundance.

196
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,090
Do you love something for its faithfulness?

197
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,035
Nothing is more firm in faith than that.

198
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:14,078
Do you love something for its convenience?

199
00:22:14,078 --> 00:22:16,801
Nothing is more convenient than the love of this itself.

200
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:19,621
Does something draw you with its severity or pleasantness?

201
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:21,955
Nothing is more magnificent or worthy than that.

202
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:24,970
Kindness is required in adversity and sweetness in prosperity.

203
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,617
It is unique in providing either joy in happy times or solace in sad times.

204
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:34,453
Therefore, it is most reasonable for you to love Him above all, in whom you have everything.

205
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:39,427
Wealth and whatever else currently delights you not only reside within Him but also come from Him.

206
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:42,929
Let your scattered love henceforth be devoted to divine watchfulness.

207
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,837
Your wandering affection should be brought back to sacred use, now pure love.

208
00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:54,704
Correct and direct your straying affection, suppressing error, and turn your love towards God, because whatever you love now is His; His, I say, it is His.

209
00:22:54,704 --> 00:23:00,490
For He is so great that those who do not love Him, unfairly indeed, still cannot love anything except what is His.

210
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:16,325
Yet, I would like a just judge to consider whether it is fair to love the work while neglecting and abandoning the Creator of all things; to rush into desires and pursuits for His creation indiscriminately, when surely it should have been proper to be drawn to love God through this very affection for His works.

211
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:27,745
And now man is turned against Him, towards the desires and services of unworthy creations, with minds discordantly at odds, seeking the art but abandoning the artist, embracing the appearance without marveling at its creator.

212
00:23:27,745 --> 00:23:31,095
And what have we said about that great multitude of His sweetness?

213
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:36,373
Or what have we spoken of such great and ineffable goodness, the holy and profound treasure of His love?

214
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:41,246
Or when has anyone ever been able to fully express the dignity of this matter by speaking of it?

215
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:45,610
Therefore, let us consider that loving Him is not only pleasurable but also necessary.

216
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:50,026
Indeed, it is impious not to love Him, to whom you cannot repay even when you love Him.

217
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:55,507
It is most unjust not to want to give Him what you can, to whom, even if you wanted to, you could not repay.

218
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:58,604
For what shall we return to the Lord for all He has given us?

219
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:12,510
Psalms 116:12 asks, "What shall I return to the Lord for all His bounty to me?" What shall we return, even for this one thing, that through faith He gave salvation to man and established it, so that it was as easy as possible to spread hope to the world and life to mortals.

220
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:21,342
And to delve into these matters, do you think that all those external things, like nations and kingdoms, came under Roman control and law for any other reason?

221
00:24:21,342 --> 00:24:30,021
Was it not so that faith might penetrate more easily through one nation, like medicine through one body, allowing what is given to the head to quickly spread to the limbs?

222
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:37,635
Otherwise, there wouldn't have been such a unification among nations with different customs and languages, nor such a long journey through new stages.

223
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:46,771
Finally, Blessed Paul, noting the spread of faith through this same people, writes that from Jerusalem all the way to Illyricum, he has filled everything with the Gospel of Christ.

224
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:48,750
Romans chapter fifteen, verse nineteen.

225
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:53,877
When would this have happened among nations, either countless in number or savage in their barbarity?

226
00:24:53,877 --> 00:25:00,018
This is why now the whole earth, from the rising to the setting of the sun, from the north and the sea, proclaims Christ.

227
00:25:00,018 --> 00:25:06,718
This is why all sides of the world converge towards life, while the Thracian, the Libyan, the Syrian, and the Spaniard accept faith.

228
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:13,875
Therefore, a great proof of divine mercy is that under Caesar Octavian, when the Roman Empire was at its peak, God gave Himself to the earth.

229
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:31,183
So, to quote your own words, when about 1,185 years had passed since the beginning of this kingdom, whatever was added to the Roman Empire under the ancient kings or later under the dual administration of the consuls, all was prepared and provided for the coming of Christ and the spread of faith, if anyone is a suitable witness to show it.

230
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:32,604
We will return to the topic.

231
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:39,456
Do not love the world or the things in the world, First John chapter two, because all these things deceive our sight with false colors.

232
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:47,070
The power of the eyes, given to light, should not be directed to error: and while it is open to the uses of life, it should not admit causes of death.

233
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,384
The desires of the flesh, as the Apostle excellently says, wage war against the soul.

234
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:51,993
First Peter.

235
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:59,385
All these things are prepared for our destruction and disaster; they keep a vigilant watch, rising against us like foreign enemies.

236
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:02,088
They gain as much strength as they take away from us.

237
00:26:02,088 --> 00:26:10,351
So far, I have spoken about the inescapable temptations of this deceitful world, including honors and riches, as if the world thrived on its pleasant allurements.

238
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:16,472
Whatever appearance those things once had, polished with a sheen, has now faded, and all false splendor has disappeared.

239
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:18,818
The world now barely has the power to deceive.

240
00:26:18,818 --> 00:26:22,592
The image of those things, once beautiful enough to deceive, has perished.

241
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:28,458
It used to try to seduce us with true brilliance but could not; now it almost cannot corrupt us with false display.

242
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:31,620
It lacked solid goods, and now it even fails in fleeting ones.

243
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:38,505
Neither temporary ornaments adorn it, nor do enduring ones strengthen it; unless we deceive ourselves, the world can hardly deceive us.

244
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:41,107
But why do we hesitate to express what is stronger?

245
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:47,074
We speak of the dissipated wealth of the world, while the world itself is moving towards its end in its final stages.

246
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:50,492
How much greater and more serious is it that it will not last long?

247
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:52,583
Why do we recall its worn-out belongings?

248
00:26:52,583 --> 00:27:01,661
It is not without reason that, with its strength consumed by age, it is pressured into decline and abandoned by its supports, as it now collapses under the burden of its old age.

249
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:05,538
The last age of the world is filled with evils like the diseases of old age.

250
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:10,740
Famine, pestilence, devastation, wars, and terrors have been seen and are still seen in this gray age.

251
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,984
These are the weaknesses of its final years.

252
00:27:12,984 --> 00:27:18,544
Hence, those signs in the sky, earthquakes, changing seasons, and monstrous births of animals are often seen.

253
00:27:18,544 --> 00:27:22,471
All these are still wonders of the passing time, but they are already fading.

254
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:27,725
And this is confirmed not only by our weak words but also by the authoritative sayings of the apostles.

255
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:31,958
For it is written: "The ends of the ages have come upon us" (First Corinthians 10).

256
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:35,120
Since this was said long ago, why do we delay, why do we wait?

257
00:27:36,192 --> 00:27:39,695
That day compels us, not just for ourselves, but for our time as well.

258
00:27:39,695 --> 00:27:47,453
Every hour reminds us that the moment of decision is near, where the end, with its uncertain danger and dual crises, threatens everyone equally with death.

259
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:51,107
The world's mortality now weighs on me, as if my own fear weren't enough.

260
00:27:51,107 --> 00:27:52,358
Why do we fuel our fears?

261
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:57,113
There's no room for security when the end threatens us all, both individually and collectively.

262
00:27:57,113 --> 00:28:06,222
How much worse is the miserable condition of people, not just at the end of an age, but even in its decline; who neither place their hope in future joys, nor enjoy present pleasures.

263
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:10,126
They don't seize the joy of this brief life and have no hope for eternal life.

264
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:13,229
They don't use temporal goods, nor will they use eternal ones.

265
00:28:13,229 --> 00:28:16,132
Here, there's little substance, and there, no hope at all.

266
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:31,248
This is a truly pitiable and miserable state of humanity; unless perhaps, one turns this bitter condition into a necessary correction, striving for better remedies and more wholesome desires; especially when the present time is so torn apart that losing the benefit of one future age means losing both.

267
00:28:31,248 --> 00:28:38,155
All our focus must be directed to the hope of the future: to achieve this hope more fully and clearly, I won't hesitate to use an example.

268
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:49,166
If someone today offers you 5 bronze coins and promises 500 gold coins tomorrow, giving you the option to take the bronze now or wait for the gold: is there any doubt you would prefer the larger reward with a small wait?

269
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:56,273
You, too, considering the nature of this brief and eternal life, wouldn't choose the worthless things when you can hope for the precious ones.

270
00:28:56,273 --> 00:29:00,427
It's not worth taking the small things when it's better to wait for the great ones.

271
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:09,787
If all the fragile things in the world, which we see and grasp (for hope is based on what we hope for), it's clear that hope is not to be found in this age, in which we enjoy what we see.

272
00:29:09,787 --> 00:29:11,489
For hope that is seen is not hope.

273
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,681
For who hopes for what they see? (Romans 8:24).

274
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:22,163
Therefore, whatever hope mixes with human affairs must be sought in the future; otherwise, it cannot even be called hope if it is not hoped for.

275
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:27,514
And so, we follow a more evident hope in the future than the hope of what we experience in the present.

276
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:37,489
Behold, the things close to our eyes are not looked at absolutely as if our vision is overwhelmed; but much more certainly, we focus on things offered from a distance, as if our eyes are free.

277
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:42,269
Therefore, it is not to be doubted that it happens similarly with present and future things.

278
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:49,595
For present things, as if thrust into our eyes, are not seen correctly; future things, as if drawn back from our eyes, are seen most clearly.

279
00:29:49,595 --> 00:30:11,727
And we do not presume this confidence in future things from an uncertain author, but from our Lord Jesus Christ, the truest guarantor of truth, who promises an endless kingdom to the just and ample rewards of the most blessed eternity; who also, through the ineffable sacrament of assumed flesh, being both man and God, reconciled man to God; and through the great and hidden mystery of his passion, absolved the world of sin.

280
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:28,976
Thus, he was manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed in the world, taken up in glory: for this reason, God exalted him, so that everything in heaven, on earth, in the sea, and in the depths, may now confess that the Lord Jesus is in glory, King and God before all ages.

281
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:29,807
(Philippians 2).

282
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:38,483
Why don't you, rejecting the precepts of philosophers to which you apply your effort and intellect, turn your mind to the studies of Christian teaching to imbibe them?

283
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:48,303
There, too, you will find material for your eloquence and intellect to exercise; and it will soon be clear to you how much our precepts of piety and truth surpass those of the philosophers.

284
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:54,901
For in their precepts, either virtue is shadowed, or wisdom is false; but in these, true justice and solid truth are contained.

285
00:30:54,901 --> 00:31:00,148
Hence, it is legitimate to say that others have usurped the name of philosophy, but we have the life.

286
00:31:00,148 --> 00:31:04,772
Indeed, what kind of precepts for living can be given by those who do not know the cause?

287
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:11,765
Ignorant of God and turning away from righteousness from the very beginning, they fall into further error in other matters.

288
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:14,693
Thus, it happens that the end of such pursuits is vanity.

289
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:19,572
If some among them define more honorable things, they serve this boastfulness and labor for it.

290
00:31:19,572 --> 00:31:22,808
Thus, among them, abstinence from vices is not free from vices.

291
00:31:22,808 --> 00:31:26,352
These are, as it is written, those who are focused on earthly things.

292
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:27,277
Philippians 3:19
.

293
00:31:27,277 --> 00:31:31,489
Hence, it is clearly shown that they do not see true righteousness or true wisdom.

294
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:43,046
Will anyone from that school of Aristippus see the truth, who in his nature is no different from pigs or cattle, when he places happiness in bodily pleasure: whose god is his stomach, and whose glory is in his shameful parts?

295
00:31:43,046 --> 00:31:48,850
Will he teach what is honorable and just, who philosophizes while being a spendthrift, shameless, and adulterous?

296
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:55,630
But let another occasion be reserved for speaking against philosophers; I will now come to those matters for which I speak with you.

297
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:05,029
Leave aside those general opinions of theirs that you find pleasing, mostly brief and collected from various disputations, and turn yourself to the studies and writings of our people.

298
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:08,060
There, you will satisfy your mind with diverse instruction.

299
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:15,662
There, to instill faith, you will hear not these exact words but the following meanings:
The Word of God, who does not believe, does not understand.

300
00:32:15,662 --> 00:32:21,260
There, you will be reminded: Fear the Lord, because you call Him Lord; love Him, because you call Him Father.

301
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:27,527
There, you will learn about true sacrifices by hearing: The most acceptable sacrifices to God are righteousness and mercy.

302
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:34,563
There, it will be suggested to you: If you love yourself, love your neighbor; for nothing benefits you more than what you give to others.

303
00:32:34,563 --> 00:32:40,316
There, it will be commanded to you: Do not consider any cause so worthy that it justifies the death of a person.

304
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:48,534
There, you will be advised against unlawful acts: Resist lust as the most bitter enemy, who rejoices in insulting the defeated, even with the shame of the body.

305
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:54,441
There, you will be taught not to covet: It is better to not want what you do not have than to have what you desire.

306
00:32:54,441 --> 00:33:01,016
There, you will be instructed not to get angry: He who gets angry when provoked only does not get angry when he is not provoked.

307
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:09,032
You will hear about enemies: The one who is loved does not love the one who loves, because hardly anyone does not love the one who loves them.

308
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:13,643
It will be repeated to you often: He who divides his treasure with the needy, stores it well.

309
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:16,519
For he cannot lose what he has invested by giving it away.

310
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:21,825
You will be persuaded of happier things, when it is said: The result of faithful marriages is self-control.

311
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:27,180
You will learn to discern when you hear: The evils of this world are common to both the just and the unjust.

312
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:33,427
You will be offered this to hear: Greater sorrow is when the soul suffers from vices than when the body suffers from diseases.

313
00:33:33,427 --> 00:33:39,030
This will be pronounced to commend peace to you: Similarity of manners among the impatient is a cause of discord.

314
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:47,657
To avoid following the wicked, you will hear: The wise and the prudent inform, and the foolish; the former teaches what should be imitated; the latter what should be avoided.

315
00:33:47,657 --> 00:33:54,301
These things too are brought forth: Many things benefit the ignorant; therefore, God's kindness is no less in secret than in the open.

316
00:33:54,301 --> 00:34:01,342
You will be reminded: Give thanks to God not more in prosperity than in adversity; and when things go well, admit that you did not deserve it.

317
00:34:01,342 --> 00:34:11,308
More distant things will also be revealed to you when these are preached: Ask the nations or their laws whether there is fate; for they certainly do not punish, except according to the will of actions.

318
00:34:11,308 --> 00:34:16,911
You will hear these things prescribed to maintain purity: If you want to be truthful, you will not be suspicious.

319
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:18,994
For we do not suspect what we do not know.

320
00:34:18,994 --> 00:34:26,233
You will also hear this about higher matters: With the mind fixed on God, when it is tickled by passions, it is brought down from heaven to earth.

321
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:37,240
You will be reminded of these things too: When here the wicked sometimes receive good things, and the good are afflicted by evils; those who do not believe in God's future judgment judge God unjust (which should never be).

322
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:43,736
It will be suggested to you: Do not do in secret what you wish people not to know; do not even think what you wish God not to know.

323
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:48,248
You will be told against all deceit: It is more unfortunate to deceive than to be deceived.

324
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:53,751
These things will also be prescribed to you against boasting: Avoid vanity all the more, the better you become.

325
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:56,875
For other vices grow with vices, but vanity grows with virtues.

326
00:34:57,768 --> 00:35:00,914
These few insights into studies have been briefly touched upon.

327
00:35:00,914 --> 00:35:07,406
But if you delve into the very sources of sacred texts, you will marvel not only at the surface but even more at the depth within.

328
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:14,198
When Scripture shines from within, like a precious gem at the bottom, it draws the eyes of those who contemplate into its deep radiance.

329
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:21,490
Train yourself not to turn away from the dimming vision of the mind; learn to satisfy the soul's hunger with this inner and wholesome nourishment.

330
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:29,281
We do not doubt that through the work of the merciful Lord, you will desire our teachings, disdain your own, shun the trivial, and long for the substantial.

331
00:35:29,281 --> 00:35:38,920
It is most foolish, when God has done so much for us, that we have done nothing for ourselves; and although He has looked to human welfare in His works, man is unwilling to provide for himself.

332
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,915
Indeed, we provide for ourselves if we return our affection and devotion to God.

333
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:48,458
True happiness is to scorn the happiness of the world and, neglecting earthly things, to burn with divine love.

334
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:52,504
Therefore, from now on, direct all your words and deeds to God or for God's sake.

335
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:56,000
Ensure that she always accompanies you, and she will be your guardian.

336
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,498
Innocence is already faithful.

337
00:35:57,498 --> 00:36:01,044
It is great to follow virtue and to contribute to it with our strength.

338
00:36:01,044 --> 00:36:05,389
Do not fear that the soul cannot free itself from the habits of life for a better life.

339
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:10,483
The same one to whom we offer ourselves to be healed and protected provides strength to our affection.

340
00:36:10,483 --> 00:36:11,482
From where, however?

341
00:36:11,482 --> 00:36:15,677
So that anyone might be able to grasp the reward of future goods even in estimation.

342
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:21,220
Behold the divine generosity, as we see, has granted the use of the most beloved light to all indiscriminately.

343
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:30,709
The common sun is given to the pious and impious alike; all creation serves its duty with kind services, and the entire world's possession is indiscriminately shared by the good and the bad.

344
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:35,803
Since God grants such splendid things to the just and unjust here, what must be reserved for the just?

345
00:36:35,803 --> 00:36:38,950
Let us consider, He who gave so much, how much will He restore?

346
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,996
He who is so great in gifts, how great will He be in rewards?

347
00:36:41,996 --> 00:36:46,591
If the generosity of the giver is so immeasurable, what will be that of the one who rewards?

348
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:56,587
The things God has prepared for those who love Him are beyond description, truly immense, especially considering how greatly He rewards the good who give so much to the ungrateful.

349
00:36:56,587 --> 00:37:03,297
Look around, and from the sea of your concerns, look ahead and steer your course, as if navigating toward the harbor of our profession.

350
00:37:03,297 --> 00:37:08,318
This is the one harbor to which we are brought back from all the turbulence of the fluctuating world.

351
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:14,581
We seek it, weary, among the crashing waves of life; here everyone must flee who is harassed by the storm of the raging world.

352
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:17,216
Here is the most faithful station, and certain peace.

353
00:37:17,216 --> 00:37:19,949
Here a wide recess, shut off from the waves, is silent.

354
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:21,938
Here gentle tranquility shines serenely.

355
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:27,555
When you have been brought here, your ship will be safely held by the anchor of the cross after fruitless labors.

356
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:30,139
But now, the longer page of writings demands an end.

357
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:35,309
Receive the essence of the heavenly commandments, collected briefly and concisely, for the honor of God.

358
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:38,142
These are all the commands, forgive me, and recognize me.
