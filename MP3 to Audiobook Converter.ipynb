    "# MP3 to Audiobook Converter\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook provides a user-friendly interface to combine multiple MP3 files from a specified directory into a single file and convert it to an audiobook format (m4b).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enter Directory Path**:\n",
    "   - Enter the path to the directory containing your MP3 files in the input box below.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Combining Files**:\n",
    "   - Click the \"Submit\" button to start the combining process.\n",
    "   - The system will automatically combine the files in the specified order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Converting to Audiobook Format**:\n",
    "   - After combining the files, the notebook will convert the resulting MP3 file into an audiobook format (`.m4b`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatic Combining**: MP3 files are combined in the correct order based on their filenames.\n",
    "- **Audiobook Conversion**: The combined MP3 file is converted to the m4b format, suitable for audiobook players.\n",
    "- **User-Friendly Interface**: The notebook uses `ipywidgets` to provide a seamless and interactive experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Make sure `ffmpeg` is installed on your system. You can install it using a package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg` on Debian-based systems or `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, proceed to the code cells below to start the process.\n"
