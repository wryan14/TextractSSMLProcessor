        The Evangelical United Brethren Church was created in 1946 by the union of The Church of the United Brethren in Christ and The Evangelical Church. <s>The new body found its life and expression rooted in the two former churches.</s> <s>These two churches were American born due to a rebirth of spirit and not because of a theological revolt.</s> <s>They accepted, confessed, and defended "the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints."</s> <s>At the time of their union in 1946, they did not change their Confession of Faith.</s> <s>They simply made a new affirmation of their faith so The Evangelical United Brethren Church is in reality a continuous succession of historic and evangelical Christianity.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Joint Commission on Church Federation and Union in 1946 formulated a Plan and Basis of Union and declared, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɪn">"In</phoneme> all the basic and enduring elements of faith and ecclesiastical organization they <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ðeɪ">(<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ðiz">these</phoneme> churches) are alike."</phoneme> <s>This declaration was approved by both uniting churches in their vote on the Plan and Basis of Union.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1958, the General Conference authorized the Board of Bishops to conduct a study of the respective Confessions of Faith of the two former communions with a view to combining both statements into one unified statement of faith.
    </p>


  <p>
    This was done by engaging leaders of the Church in dialogue on each article and then preparing a statement of faith for presentation to the General Conference, Grand Rapids, Michigan, October 1962:
  </p>
  <p>
    "WHEREAS, This Confession of Faith as adopted is a continuance of and is in fact The Confession of Faith of the Church of The United Brethren in Christ' and The Articles of Faith and The Doctrines of Regeneration, Sanctification and Christian Perfection of The Evangelical Church' as stated in the 1947 edition of the Discipline; and
  </p>
  <p>
    "WHEREAS, It is well to reaffirm the doctrinal statement as set forth in The Plan and Basis of Union as therein stated; now therefore be it
  </p>
  <p>
    "Resolved, That we do hereby solemnly declare and affirm that the single creedal statement, The Confession of Faith of The Evangelical United Brethren Church, is a continuance of both of the earlier creedal statements of our Church and is in agreement with the doctrines of the Christian religion as contained in the Holy Scriptures and accepted and held by The Evangelical United Brethren Church; and we do hereby declare before all men our acceptance of this doctrinal confession as 'The Confession of Faith of The Evangelical United Brethren Church.'
  </p>
  <p>
    The doctrinal content of this book has been approved by the Board of Bishops of The Evangelical United Brethren Church according to the provisions of The Discipline, Paragraph 1866.

        This book seeks to give fuller understanding and meaning to the stately words of the Confession of Faith of The Evangelical United Brethren Church. Primarily it is a book for adults. It is not intended to be a <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="pəˈpjʊlər">popular</phoneme> book for easy reading. It is for the earnest seeker after truth.

    <p>
        A Confession of Faith is a brief statement. It is a summary of all that could be said. Therefore, a Confession should be accompanied by a more comprehensive exposition or commentary. This book is such an exposition and commentary.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Confession of Faith of The Evangelical United Brethren Church has sixteen articles. Each article is given attention in one chapter of this book. Each chapter has been written by a different person. The appropriate article, quoted verbatim from <sub alias="The Discipline">The Discipline</sub>, appears at the beginning of each chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
        A book written by sixteen authors has certain advantages. Sixteen writers give a book a richness of background and experience surpassing that of any one writer. Sixteen writers provide a variety of style and a change of pace that are refreshing. On the other hand, a book produced by sixteen writers runs certain risks. There may be duplications, omissions, differences of emphasis, and even variations of opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The writers of this book include six bishops, four theological seminary professors, one conference superintendent, one pastor, one woman who is a church editor, and three lay men who are respectively a lawyer, a physician, and <break time="500ms" />.
    </p>


    <p>
        The six bishops and the four professors who have contributed chapters, plus the editor, spent the better part of two years studying and preparing the Confession of Faith of The Evangelical United Brethren Church for presentation to, and adoption by, the 1962 General Conference of the denomination. The other six writers were enlisted to give variety and scope to the total authorship of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each writer is responsible for his or her views as set forth in the various chapters. No editorial pressure was applied to obtain conformity to a theological point-of-view, or to a certain style of writing. All the authors, being loyal and thoughtful members of The Evangelical United Brethren Church, wrote within the framework of Evangelical United Brethren doctrine and polity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each writer made his or her contribution to the book from the vantage point of his position in the Church, out of his own religious life, and with the background of his own education and professional experience. Some of the writers dealt with the words of the Confession of Faith in detail. Others sought to interpret the spirit of the article in an inspirational manner without close regard to specifics. Some wrote as classroom professors, some as church administrators, some as pastors and preachers, and some as dedicated members of the laity.

    <p>
        "We believe in the one true, holy and living God, Eternal Spirit, who is Creator, Sovereign and Preserver of all things visible and invisible. He is infinite in power, wisdom, justice, goodness and love, and rules with gracious regard for the well-being and salvation of men, to the glory of his name. We believe the one God reveals himself as the Trinity: Father, Son and Holy Spirit, distinct but inseparable, eternally one in essence and power."

        Thornton Wilder in the play, "Our Town," gives the address of a letter to one of the characters in the play as:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Jane Crofut, The Crofut Farm, Grover's Corners, Sutton County, New Hampshire, United States of America, Continent of North America, Western Hemisphere, The Earth, The Solar System, The Universe, The Mind of God."
    </p>
    <p>
        Some such address would be correct for each of us. Our little lives, our troubled human family, our beloved Church, our world community of nations, have their location eventually in The Mind of God. In the Bible we read:
    </p>
    <p>
        "The God who created the world and everything in it, and who is Lord of heaven and earth is himself the universal giver of life and breath and all else. He created every race of men of one stock, to inhabit the whole earth."

        He fixed the epochs of their history and the limits of their territory. They were to seek God, and, it might be, touch and find him; <s>though indeed he is not far from each one of us, for in him we live and move, in him we exist.</s>

        An earnest, sincere desire to recapture certainty about God in the life of the individual, in the family circle, and in church fellowship requires disciplined thought, Bible study and prayer. What are some tried and trusted guides for the Christian who seeks to verify the meaning of the living God for modern times? 
        <s>The basic elements seem clear.</s>

    <p>
        The New Testament outlines simply two first principles which are brought to life in this passage from the Epistle to the Hebrews:
        <break time="500ms" />
        "The man who approaches God must have faith in two things, first that God exists, and secondly that it is worth a man's while to try to find God." 
        <sub alias="Hebrews eleven six">Hebrews 11:6</sub>, J. B. Phillips Translation.
    </p>


    <p>
        First, we should approach the living God with faith and expectancy. <s>The prospector for gold believes that gold exists.</s> <s>His search is reinforced by the findings of others, and he uses the best implements available to aid his quest.</s> <s>As a seeker, he is confident that his search will be rewarded and that he will be a finder.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        The living God invites the seeker. <s>The questing spirit is essential.</s> <s>The Bible makes clear that the seeking mind and spirit are essential if fresh discoveries of the divine presence, power, and saving grace are to be made.</s> <s><phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="siːk ðə lɔːrd waɪl hiː meɪ bi faʊnd, kɔːl əˈpɒn hɪm waɪl hiː ɪz nɪər">Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near.</phoneme></s> <s><sub alias="Isaiah">Isaiah</sub> 55:6.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Master himself, in his Sermon on the Mount, extends an invitation to earnest, thoughtful, inquiring minds to become seekers for the reality of the living God, our Father. <s><phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="æsk, ænd ɪt wɪl bi ˈɡɪvən juː; siːk ænd juː wɪl faɪnd; nɒk, ænd ɪt wɪl bi ˈoʊpənd tuː juː">Ask, and it will be given you; seek and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.</phoneme></s> <s><sub alias="Matthew">Matthew</sub> 7:7.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        Jesus Christ offers us in this "age of anxiety" the knowledge of the living God, who can be known and trusted. <s>For the mad race after material things, he substitutes the search for values which are enduring and satisfying.</s> <s><phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="siːk fɜːrst hɪz ˈkɪŋdəm ænd hɪz ˈraɪtʃəsnɪs, ænd ɔːl ðiːz θɪŋz ʃæl bi jɔːrz æz wɛl">Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.</phoneme></s> <s><sub alias="Matthew">Matthew</sub> 6:33.</s>

    Surrender made possible. He was led to rethink the nature of God in the light of new truth. This new truth came home to Paul, the researcher, when the God of all-creative power broke through into life as love divine seeking to save the sinner and the sinful race. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of Paul, a Christ-centered experience led to a Christ-centered thought about God. The meaning of life was illuminated by the suffering and victory of Christ crucified and risen. The theological statement made by Paul should be seen as testimony concerning discoveries made and tested in the heat of life's struggle. Behind Paul's affirmation are long years of missionary and evangelistic endeavor and sacrificial self-giving.

    This Article of Faith refers to the Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This is one of the great concepts of the Christian religion. In defining the Holy Trinity, the early church fathers were trying to explain how the God whom they knew as Creator of the world is at the same time the God known in Jesus Christ and the God known as the Holy Spirit. A right idea of the Trinity is the source of great inspiration and personal spiritual power. Use this opportunity through meditation, Bible study, reading, and discussion to get a firm understanding of the Holy Trinity and his relationship to your life.

      We can understand many of the statements in our Confession of Faith in this context.
    </s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>
      Ith as an attempt to guard against these three errors.
      Let us consider them in turn.
    </s>
    <s>
      The first error is to think of Jesus as 
      <phoneme ph="ˈæ">A</phoneme>
      <phoneme ph="ˈmænˌlaɪk">Manlike</phoneme>
      God (but not really a man).
    </s>
    <s>
      To those who think thus, Jesus seemed to be only a man; or perhaps only pretended to be a man.
    </s>
    <s>
      According to this point of view, Jesus was God masquerading in human form.
    </s>
    <s>
      He knew already as a little child that he would be crucified.
    </s>
    <s>
      He was never really tempted.
    </s>
    <s>
      Against this erroneous view, our Confession affirms that Jesus was truly man, having a human nature, and was 
      <phoneme ph="ˈmeɪd ˈflɛʃ">"made flesh."</phoneme>
    </s>
    <s>
      He knew every tension and struggle that we know.
    </s>
  </p>
  <break time="1s" />
  <p>
    <s>
      The second error is to think of Jesus as 
      <phoneme ph="ˈeɪ">A</phoneme>
      <phoneme ph="ˈɡɑdlaɪk">Godlike</phoneme>
      Man (but not really God).
    </s>
    <s>
      There have always been those who thought of Jesus only as a 
      <phoneme ph="ˈɡreɪt ˈtiːʧər">"great teacher,"</phoneme>
      or a 
      <phoneme ph="ˈwʌndərfəl ˈmɔrəl ɪɡˈzæmpl">"wonderful moral example,"</phoneme>
      or perhaps a 
      <phoneme ph="ˈtru ˈprɑfɪt">"true prophet."</phoneme>
    </s>
    <s>
      This idea suggests that Jesus was a great and good man whom God especially blessed and used, but he was exclusively human.
    </s>
    <s>
      Against this position, our Confession of Faith affirms that Jesus was truly God, having a divine nature.
    </s>
    <s>
      We affirm that Jesus was 
      <sub alias="the only begotten Son of the Father">"the only begotten Son of the Father,"</sub>
      born of the Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit.
    </s>
  </p>
  <break time="1s" />
  <p>
    <s>
      The basic meaning of the doctrine of the virgin birth is to be seen precisely at this point.
    </s>
    <s>
      This doctrine affirms that Jesus is by nature and eternally the unique Son of God, and that he entered the realm of nature as a human being.
    </s>
  </p>


    <p>
        nd history as such. He was the unique Son of God from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
        The third kind of error sees Jesus as <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɡɒd mæn">"God/Man"</phoneme> <sub alias="but">but</sub> neither really God nor really man. This error is the result of the human mind trying to arrive at some simple, logical explanation as to how Jesus could be both truly God and truly man. The explanation usually has been in some such terms as Jesus had a human body, but a divine mind, soul, or spirit. The terrible result of this too-simple suggestion, however, is that it conceives Jesus as some kind of split-person who is neither completely human nor divine. Against this view, our Confession of Faith positively affirms that in Jesus "the divine and human natures are perfectly and inseparably united."
    </p>
    <p>
        We are provided no explanation how this union can be. The <sub alias="how">"how"</sub> is left a mystery. If eternal God revealed his very being in a truly human man, we cannot expect some simple explanation as to how this occurred. This event is not simple or common. It is unique, unprecedented, and mysterious.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may ask the question as to <sub alias="how">"how,"</sub> and seek an answer. But the Church has never prescribed an answer to this question. No answer is adequate or acceptable which in any way violates the truth that God uniquely revealed himself in the fully human person, Jesus of Nazareth.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Church, however, uses certain ideas to illuminate the meaning of this mystery. Let us now try to give further definition to the ideas used in our Confession. These ideas come to us from the mind of the Church.
    </p>


    <p>
        The early church, which in turn largely rested upon the long experience of Israel as recorded in the Old Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most important idea or concept is the title "Christ." Many use this word as though it were a part of Jesus' name. It is not that at all, but it is a title which describes his meaning. <w role="ivona:NN">Christ</w> is the Greek version of the Hebrew word "Messiah," which means <sub alias="the Anointed one">the Anointed one</sub>. The Jews used this word to designate the one they expected God to send in order to bring God's Kingdom fully into history. Christians call Jesus <phoneme ph="ðə kraɪst">the Christ</phoneme> because they believe he fulfilled this Jewish expectation, even though not precisely in the way some Jews expected it to be fulfilled. The Kingdom of God did come into history in and with Jesus, and thus he is the Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jesus is also called <phoneme ph="ðə ɪˈtɜrnəl wɜrd">the eternal Word</phoneme> in our Confession. <phoneme ph="wɜrd">Word</phoneme> is the English translation for the Greek concept of <phoneme ph="ˈloʊɡɒs">Logos</phoneme>. In Greek philosophy, <phoneme ph="ˈloʊɡɒs">Logos</phoneme> means the principle of universal reason or the divine principle of creativity. The use of this concept in the New Testament, however, very likely had a more strongly Jewish background. The <phoneme ph="wɜrd">Word</phoneme> ("dabhar" in Hebrew) was one of the ways the Old Testament speaks of the creative activity of God. (See Psalms 33:6, 9.) Whether of Greek or Jewish background, to call Jesus <phoneme ph="ðə ɪˈtɜrnəl wɜrd meɪd flɛʃ">the eternal Word made flesh</phoneme> is to say that the meaning of the whole world process is to be found in this person.
    </p>
    <p>
        Christ As Savior and Mediator
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Confession also speaks of Jesus as...
    </p>


  <p>
    The word <w role="amazon:NN">"salvation"</w> should be understood according to its root meaning of health or wholeness of human life, the essential soundness and completeness of the human person.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus is called <w role="amazon:NN">"Savior"</w> because the Christian finds healing and wholeness restored to his divided and distorted personality through his relationship with Jesus Christ. He is Savior because he is also Mediator. Any <w role="amazon:NN">"mediator"</w> is one who stands between two separated parties in order to bring them together. Jesus is the Divine Mediator because in Christian experience he is the only one who can reconcile the righteous and merciful God with a sinful man.
  </p>
  <p>
    <w role="amazon:NN">Christ's</w> Work to be Fulfilled
  </p>
  <p>
    We should note that this work of Christ for our salvation continues in the present and into the future. Our Confession asserts that Christ now <sub alias="intercedes">inter-cedes</sub> for us, and that he shall return. Christ's saving work is finished in the Cross and Resurrection, but we look forward to its final fulfillment in God's good time. We already know the joy of his love, and hope for the time when his love will overcome all the unloveliness which continues in our present history.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last phrase of our Confession asserts that the love of Christ is the standard by which all men will be judged, and that the person of Christ is the judge. As Christians we are glad to accept so righteous and so gracious a judgment, desiring nothing more than to have our lives conformed to his loving will by the influence of his Holy Spirit.
