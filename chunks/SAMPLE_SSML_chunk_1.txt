        Lectures were delivered in the semi-ruins of the once stately <phoneme ph="kʊɾˈfʊɾstən ʃlɔs">Kurfürsten Schloss</phoneme> in Bonn, in which the University had later been established. <break time="500ms" /> The hour was seven a.m., always after we had sung a psalm or a hymn to cheer us up. <break time="500ms" /> About eight o'clock, the rebuilding in the quadrangle began to advertise itself in the rattle of an engine for breaking up the ruins. <s> I may say that with my inquisitive ways, among the rubbish I came upon an undamaged bust of <phoneme ph="ʃlaɪ'ɚmakɚ">Schleiermacher</phoneme>, which was rescued and somewhere restored to honor again. </s> The audience consisted partly of theologians, but the larger part was of students from the other faculties. <break time="500ms" /> Most people in Germany today have in their own way and in their own place endured and survived much, almost beyond all measure. <s> I noted the same in my Bonn lads. </s> With their grave faces, which had still to learn how to smile again, they no less impressed me than I them. <break time="500ms" /> I, who was an alien, the center of all sorts of gossip from old times. <break time="500ms" /> For me, the situation will remain unforgettable. <s> By a mere coincidence, it was my fiftieth semester. </s> And when it was past, my impression was that for me it was the best ever.

        I really hesitated to publish these lectures as a book. <s> I have already published two paraphrases of the Apostles' Creed, the Credo of 1935 and the Confession de la Foi de l'Église of 1943. </s> Attentive readers of this book will scarcely discover in this third attempt much that is essentially new; and those who read the larger volumes of the <phoneme ph="kɪɾçˈlɪç">Kirchlich</phoneme> <sub alias="Dogmatik">Dogmatik</sub> will find here, too, the same thoughts in a more concentrated form.

    <p>
        The Dogmatik, nothing at all. Moreover, for the first time in my life, I lectured without a manuscript and discussed with some freedom the main propositions <w role="italic">(here printed in italics at the beginning of each chapter)</w>. My return to the primitive conditions which I met with in Germany made it absolutely necessary for me to dispense with a manuscript. The result which is now put before you is a slightly polished and improved shorthand transcript. The reader will miss here and there the precision which I normally strive for, and of course, have aimed at here as well. It will be noted especially towards the end that I had to hurry and that I was preoccupied with other matters besides the lectures. Friends of a downright nature may regard this weakness as an advantage, and I myself certainly enjoyed giving the lectures. Now they are published, I notice their weak points and will not grumble at any reviewer who brings them to my attention.

        When I finally yielded to the pressure put upon me by the representatives of the Verlag Zollikon, I did so thinking that what I had produced might in this looser form serve to explain things which I had elsewhere expressed more strictly and compactly but, for that very reason perhaps, less noticeably and less accessibly for all. Others, again, may possibly read the little book not without pleasure because, although it does not have too many topical references, it smacks of a document of our time, which has once more become a time <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈbɪtwiːn">between</phoneme>.

    <s>Dogmatics is the science in which the Church, in accordance with the state of its knowledge at different times, takes account of the content of its proclamation critically, that is, by the standard of Holy Scripture and under the guidance of its Confessions.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Dogmatics is a science.</s>
    <s>What science really is has already been pondered, discussed and written about infinitely often and at all periods.</s>
    <s>We cannot develop this discussion even allusively here.</s>
    <s>I offer you a concept of science which is at any rate discussible and may serve as the basis for our expositions.</s>
    <s>I propose that by science we understand an attempt at comprehension and exposition, at investigation and instruction, which is related to a definite object and sphere of activity.</s>
    <s>No act of man can claim to be more than an attempt, not even science.</s>
    <s>By describing it as an attempt, we are simply stating its nature as preliminary and limited.</s>
    <s>Wherever science is taken in practice completely seriously, we are under no illusion that anything man can do can ever be an undertaking of supreme wisdom and final art, that there exists an absolute science,</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    One that, as it were, has fallen from Heaven. Even Christian dogmatics is an attempt—an attempt to understand and an attempt to expound, an attempt to see, to hear, and to state definite facts, to survey and co-ordinate these facts, to present them in the form of a doctrine. In every science, an object is involved and a sphere of activity. In no science is it a matter of pure theory or pure practice; on the one hand, theory comes in, but also, on the other hand, practice guided by this theory.
  </p>
  <p>
    So by dogmatics, too, we understand this twofold activity of investigation and doctrine in relation to an object and a sphere of activity. The subject of dogmatics is the Christian Church. The subject of a science can only be one in which the object and sphere of activity in question are present and familiar. Therefore, it is no limitation and no vilification of the concept of dogmatics as a science to say that the subject of this science is the Church. It is the place, the community, charged with the object and the activity with which dogmatics is concerned—namely, the proclamation of the Gospel.
  </p>
  <p>
    By calling the Church the subject of dogmatics, we mean that where dogmatics is pursued, whether by pupil or by teacher, we find ourselves in the sphere of the Church. The man who seeks to occupy himself with dogmatics and deliberately puts himself outside the Church would have to reckon with the fact that for him the object of dogmatics would be alien, and should not be surprised if after the <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="fɪ">fi</phoneme>

  <p>
    <s>First steps he could not find his bearings, or even did damage.</s>
    <s>Even in dogmatics familiarity with the subject must be there, and this really means familiarity with the life of the Church.</s>
    <s>This, of course, cannot mean that in dogmatics one would have to deal with what had been said in ancient or modern times by a Church authority, so that we should merely be repeating what it had prescribed.</s>
    <s>Not even Roman Catholic dogmatics has so interpreted its task.</s>
    <s>By calling the Church the subject of dogmatics, our only thought is that whoever is occupied with this science, whether as pupil or as teacher, must take his stand in responsibility upon the basis of the Christian Church and its work.</s>
    <s>That is the </s>
    <s>But please note that this involves a free participation in the Church's life; it involves the responsibility which the Christian has to shoulder in this matter also.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>In the science of dogmatics, the Church draws up its reckoning in accordance with the state of its knowledge at different times.</s>
    <s>It might be said that this is quite obvious, given the premised concept of science.</s>
    <s>But it is not so automatically obvious, according to certain ideas about dogmatics which many have in their heads.</s>
    <s>I repeat that dogmatics is not a thing which has fallen from Heaven to earth.</s>
    <s>And if someone were to say that it would be wonderful if there were such an absolute dogmatics fallen from Heaven, the only possible answer would be: '<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="jɛs">Yes</phoneme>, if we were angels.'</s>
    <s>But since by God's will...</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>We are not, it will be good for us to have just a human and earthly dogmatics.</s>
    <s>The Christian Church does not exist in Heaven, but on earth and in time.</s>
    <s>And although it is a gift of God, He has set it right amid earthly and human circumstances, and to that fact corresponds absolutely everything that happens in the Church.</s>
    <s>The Christian Church lives on earth and it lives in history, with the lofty good entrusted to it by God.</s>
    <s>In the possession and administration of this lofty good it passes on its way through history, in strength and in weakness, in faithfulness and in unfaithfulness, in obedience and in disobedience, in understanding and in misunderstanding of what is said to it.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Amid the history unfolded upon earth, for example, that of nature and civilization, of morals and religion, of art and science, of society and the State, there is also a history of the Church.</s>
    <s>It too is a human, earthly history; and so it is not quite indefensible for Goethe to say of it that in all periods it has been a hotchpotch of error and power.</s>
    <s>If we Christians are sincere, we have to concede that this holds no less of Church history than of world history.</s>
    <s>That being so, we have cause to speak modestly and humbly of what the Church is capable of, and therefore also of the Church work that we are doing here—namely, dogmatics.</s>
    <s>Dogmatics will always be able to fulfill its task only in accordance with the state of the Church at different times.</s>
    <s>It is because the Church is conscious of its limitations.</s>
  </p>


<p>
It owes a reckoning and a responsibility to the good it has to administer and to cherish, and to the good One who has entrusted this good to it. <s>It will never be able to do this perfectly; Christian dogmatics will always be a thinking, an investigation and an exposition which are relative and liable to error.</s> <s>Even dogmatics with the best knowledge and conscience can do no more than question after the better, and never forget that we are succeeded by other, later men; and he who is faithful in this task will hope that those other, later men may think and say better and more profoundly what we were endeavouring to think and to say.</s> 
</p>
<p>
With quiet sobriety and sober quietness, we shall do our work in this way. <s>We must use our knowledge as it has been given to us to-day.</s> <s>No more can be required of us than is given to us.</s> <s>And like a servant who is faithful in little, we must not be sorrowful about such little.</s> <s>More than this faithfulness is not required of us.</s>
</p>
<p>
As a science, dogmatics takes account of the content of proclamation in the Christian Church. <s>There would be no dogmatics and there would perhaps be no theology at all, unless the Church's task consisted centrally in the proclamation of the Gospel in witness to the Word spoken by God.</s> <s>This task, which rises up again and again, this problem put to the Church from the beginning, the problem of instruction, doctrine, witness, proclamation, really stands as the question, not just for parsons and theologians, but again for all.</s>
</p>


    <p>
        And again before the Church as a whole: What as Christians do we really have to say?
        <s>For undoubtedly the Church should be the place where a word reverberates right into the world.</s>
        <s>Since the Church's task is to proclaim the Word spoken by God, which is still at the same time a human work, theology and what we today—practically since the seventeenth century—term dogmatics have been necessary from the beginning.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>In theology there is the question as to the source or provenance of the Word; and the answer to this first question will have to be given again and again in that discipline which we call exegesis.</s>
        <s>But on the other hand, there also arises the question, how?—that is, the question about the shape and form of the proclamation enjoined upon the Church; and there we find ourselves in the field of what is termed practical theology.</s>
        <s>Exactly halfway between exegesis and practical theology stands dogmatics, or, more comprehensively expressed, systematic theology.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>In dogmatics we do not ask whence Church proclamation comes and what its form is.</s>
        <s>In dogmatics our question is: What are we to think and say?</s>
        <s>Of course, that comes after we have learned from Scripture where we have to draw this 'what' from, and keeping in view the fact that we have to say something not just theoretically, but have to call something out to the world.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Precisely from this dogmatic standpoint it must be clear that the whole of theology is on the one hand really not a mere historicism,</s>
        <s>that the histo</s>
    </p>


<p>
<s>History is valid, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɪk ɛt nʊŋk">hic et nunc</phoneme>.</s>
<s>Of course, on the other hand, preaching must not degenerate into a mere technique.</s>
<s>In fact, in our time of need today, the question is more insistent than ever: what the content of Christian proclamation ought to be.</s>
<s>I should like you to pause by this 'what' for a little.</s>
<s>It is for the sake of this question that we study not only exegesis and practical theology, but dogmatics.</s>
<s>In order not to exclude Church history, I might just add that its task is <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɛnˌsɪkloʊˈpridɪk">encyclopedic</phoneme>.</s>
<s>Its special honor is to be, as it were, everywhere in the scheme, and so to have its place in Christian instruction as well.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Dogmatics is a critical science.</s>
<s>So it cannot be held, as is sometimes thought, that it is a matter of stating certain old or even new propositions that one can take home in black and white.</s>
