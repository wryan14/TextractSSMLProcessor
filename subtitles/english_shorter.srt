00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,825
Saint Eucherius, Bishop of Lyons, Exhortation to Monks.

2
00:00:02,825 --> 00:00:10,787
(From the Codex Regular of Marianus Brockie, volume 1.)
What should we offer you, dearest brothers, that would be worthy for us to say and for you to hear?

3
00:00:10,787 --> 00:00:14,743
What can we dare to speak to you, whom we also regard with silent admiration?

4
00:00:14,743 --> 00:00:18,544
How can we build you up with words when you build us up with your example?

5
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:21,986
Can we teach you what to do, when we already marvel at what you do?

6
00:00:21,986 --> 00:00:23,168
What then shall we say?

7
00:00:23,168 --> 00:00:25,993
To abandon the world, which you have already abandoned?

8
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,870
To scorn riches, which many of you have already scorned?

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,181
To flee desires, which you have already fled?

10
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:34,161
To choose healthier things, which you have already chosen?

11
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:40,582
Therefore, I will open my mouth in shared joy, fulfilling what was said: "Open your mouth, and I will fill it" (Psalm 80:11).

12
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:46,952
So I will speak to you, dearest ones, without fear; there should be no hesitation in one person where there is joy for many.

13
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:48,853
The work of God is what gives us joy.

14
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:50,445
Learn well what you teach well.

15
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:53,168
If only our mouth could preach to you as you deserve.

16
00:00:53,168 --> 00:00:59,538
What others preach rightly, you fulfill; what others speak, you do: for you display the life of angels while still on earth.

17
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:03,802
For that heavenly conduct, which few will see there, you already make visible here.

18
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:07,295
You are, as the Savior said, the light of this world (Matthew 5:14).

19
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:09,196
You are the lamp placed on the stand.

20
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:13,716
If anyone is distant from this lamp, they must be engulfed in the darkness of the world.

21
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:18,545
But whoever approaches this light will surely have eyes to see, just as they had ears to hear.

22
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:26,456
Therefore, for this lamp to have the brightest light, it must always be filled with the oil of mercy, piety, gentleness, humility, obedience, and charity.

23
00:01:26,456 --> 00:01:32,877
Humility, above all, must be cultivated, as it makes us equal to the just, joins us with angels, and brings us closer to God.

24
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:39,845
This is the person who does not fear ruin, falling, or slipping, because humility has nothing from which to fall.

25
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:41,085
Do you want not to fall?

26
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:42,273
Don't lift yourself up.

27
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:43,668
Do you want not to puff up?

28
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:44,650
Don't be puffed up.

29
00:01:44,650 --> 00:03:01,934
As someone rightly said: "Whatever swells is not healthy." For pride, which is contrary to humility, what else is it but swelling? Just as a body with swelling is not healthy, neither is a soul with pride. Therefore, humble yourself and do not seek things higher than you Ecclesiastes 3:22.
If someone wants to be proud, they can exercise their pride by being proud toward the world, despising worldly behavior, considering its desires as nothing, rising up against vices, being proud against pride itself, and having power, riches, desires, and other things that dominate the world under their feet.
Let them despise all things here considered great and magnificent as filth and dung with commendable severity: they will satisfy their pride when they see themselves in spirit above even kings. Yet if they still want to be holy and proud, they will indeed be a despiser of the world but humble to Christ. They will indeed be chosen there, but here they will be submissive: for they lift themselves up in those things so that they can more easily lower themselves to these things.
If we diligently maintain this humility, then true obedience will also be served without effort. In this obedience, beloved ones, genuine contrition is shown. For the one who judges themselves as the least is contrite in heart. When would they dare to carry out their own wills? When would they dare to resist the author who commanded them? Hence the Apostle also says: Obey your leaders, and so on (Hebrews 13:17).

30
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:04,362
But is only the one who commands to be praised?

31
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:07,410
Is not the one who obeys, beloved ones, also to be praised?

32
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,613
The former deserves glory for leading, the latter for obeying.

33
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:16,503
Therefore, a great honor and reward is aimed for by both, while one advises well, and the other obeys good advice.

34
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:24,059
This obedience was particularly emphasized by our Savior, who aimed to save us not only by redeeming us but also by teaching us obedience.

35
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:26,783
For He, being equal to the Father, obeyed the Father.

36
00:03:26,783 --> 00:03:27,810
And how did He obey?

37
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,352
Did He obey in an easy matter?

38
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:30,431
He obeyed unto death.

39
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:31,613
And what kind of death?

40
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:33,617
The death on the cross Philippians 2:8.

41
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:36,957
Not only did He obey, but He also made the Father's will His own.

42
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:44,357
For we can do what we are commanded even unwillingly; true obedience is when the one who obeys begins to want what the one who commands desires.

43
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:51,397
The Holy Scripture says: It is good for a man to carry the yoke from his youth; he will sit alone and remain silent Lamentations 3:27-28.

44
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:57,153
Therefore, with Christ helping us, let us guard our mouths with a door and bolts, and weigh our words carefully.

45
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:01,983
The Apostle says: Those who serve well gain a good standing for themselves First Timothy 3:13.

46
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:10,257
And these things, beloved ones, I do not say to instruct you, but so that you may recognize in my words the benefits of humility and obedience that you practice.

47
00:04:10,257 --> 00:04:15,807
These benefits, which draw you towards the eternal kingdom of God, we desire for you to possess unceasingly.

48
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:20,483
For it is not the one who starts, but the one who perseveres that will be saved Mark 13:13.

49
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:23,463
And to the one who wants to be saved, there is a struggle.

50
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:31,685
If someone in battle leaves their position when the lines are drawn and stands against the adversaries, they are henceforth regarded as cowardly and a deserter.

51
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:40,575
In this place too, soldiers of Christ seem to be standing as if in a battle line against the devil: to abandon the fight and leave is not only inglorious but also dangerous.

52
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:45,817
We must stay in this very place; so that by holding on to what we have, others do not take our crowns.

53
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:55,375
We must stay and remain, so that by fighting gloriously here, sailing peacefully, we may live the safest life in spiritual pursuits and grasp eternal life, for which we have been called.

54
00:04:56,351 --> 00:06:13,199
Our Savior speaks: "A city built on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, so it gives light to everyone in the house."
Matthew 5:14.
Therefore, it is fitting that such a bright lamp, originally placed under the basket of the monastery, is now transferred to the lampstand of the Church. This metaphorical basket aligns well with the monastery, where everything is done with careful measure. In the monastery, everything said or done is presented in the most equitable manner, adhering to the measure of the basket.
We can interpret the monastery through this spiritual metaphor. Like a basket, it contains nothing mixed within it. Just as wheat is separated from the chaff, the monastery receives those separated from the world. After the Lordâ€™s winnowing, which cleanses His threshing floor by ejecting the refuse outside, it keeps His chosen ones within as purer grains.
Just as the basket represents the monastery, the lampstand represents the Church. Being set in a visible or prominent place, it shows the light placed on it to everyone. A lit fire is meant to shine; hidden good does little, and hidden light shines little.
Exalt, most blessed bishop, proclaim your voice like a trumpet to the people from Heaven. Reveal the treasure you have unearthed in secret. Share the wealth you have amassed. Pour out openly to those who hunger the riches you have prepared in the wilderness, with the help of our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with God the Father and the Holy Spirit, forever and ever.
Amen.
