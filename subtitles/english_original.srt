Saint Eucherius, Bishop of Lyons, Exhortation to Monks.
(From the Codex Regular of Marianus Brockie, volume 1.)
What should we offer you, dearest brothers, that would be worthy for us to say and for you to hear?
What can we dare to speak to you, whom we also regard with silent admiration?
How can we build you up with words when you build us up with your example?
Can we teach you what to do, when we already marvel at what you do?
What then shall we say?
To abandon the world, which you have already abandoned?
To scorn riches, which many of you have already scorned?
To flee desires, which you have already fled?
To choose healthier things, which you have already chosen?
Therefore, I will open my mouth in shared joy, fulfilling what was said: "Open your mouth, and I will fill it" (Psalm 80:11).
So I will speak to you, dearest ones, without fear; there should be no hesitation in one person where there is joy for many.
The work of God is what gives us joy.
Learn well what you teach well.
If only our mouth could preach to you as you deserve.
What others preach rightly, you fulfill; what others speak, you do: for you display the life of angels while still on earth.
For that heavenly conduct, which few will see there, you already make visible here.
You are, as the Savior said, the light of this world (Matthew 5:14).
You are the lamp placed on the stand.
If anyone is distant from this lamp, they must be engulfed in the darkness of the world.
But whoever approaches this light will surely have eyes to see, just as they had ears to hear.
Therefore, for this lamp to have the brightest light, it must always be filled with the oil of mercy, piety, gentleness, humility, obedience, and charity.
Humility, above all, must be cultivated, as it makes us equal to the just, joins us with angels, and brings us closer to God.

00:01:34,007 --> 00:03:16,967
This is the person who does not fear ruin, falling, or slipping, because humility has nothing from which to fall.
Do you want not to fall? Don't lift yourself up. Do you want not to puff up? Don't be puffed up.
As someone rightly said: "Whatever swells is not healthy." For pride, which is contrary to humility, what else is it but swelling? Just as a body with swelling is not healthy, neither is a soul with pride. Therefore, humble yourself and do not seek things higher than you Ecclesiastes 3:22.
If someone wants to be proud, they can exercise their pride by being proud toward the world, despising worldly behavior, considering its desires as nothing, rising up against vices, being proud against pride itself, and having power, riches, desires, and other things that dominate the world under their feet.
Let them despise all things here considered great and magnificent as filth and dung with commendable severity: they will satisfy their pride when they see themselves in spirit above even kings. Yet if they still want to be holy and proud, they will indeed be a despiser of the world but humble to Christ. They will indeed be chosen there, but here they will be submissive: for they lift themselves up in those things so that they can more easily lower themselves to these things.
If we diligently maintain this humility, then true obedience will also be served without effort. In this obedience, beloved ones, genuine contrition is shown. For the one who judges themselves as the least is contrite in heart. When would they dare to carry out their own wills? When would they dare to resist the author who commanded them? Hence the Apostle also says: Obey your leaders, and so on (Hebrews 13:17).
But is only the one who commands to be praised? Is not the one who obeys, beloved ones, also to be praised? The former deserves glory for leading, the latter for obeying. Therefore, a great honor and reward is aimed for by both, while one advises well, and the other obeys good advice.

00:03:16,967 --> 00:04:56,351
This obedience was particularly emphasized by our Savior, who aimed to save us not only by redeeming us but also by teaching us obedience. For He, being equal to the Father, obeyed the Father. And how did He obey? Did He obey in an easy matter? He obeyed unto death. And what kind of death? The death on the cross Philippians 2:8. Not only did He obey, but He also made the Father's will His own. For we can do what we are commanded even unwillingly; true obedience is when the one who obeys begins to want what the one who commands desires.
The Holy Scripture says: It is good for a man to carry the yoke from his youth; he will sit alone and remain silent Lamentations 3:27-28. Therefore, with Christ helping us, let us guard our mouths with a door and bolts, and weigh our words carefully. The Apostle says: Those who serve well gain a good standing for themselves First Timothy 3:13.
And these things, beloved ones, I do not say to instruct you, but so that you may recognize in my words the benefits of humility and obedience that you practice. These benefits, which draw you towards the eternal kingdom of God, we desire for you to possess unceasingly. For it is not the one who starts, but the one who perseveres that will be saved Mark 13:13. And to the one who wants to be saved, there is a struggle. If someone in battle leaves their position when the lines are drawn and stands against the adversaries, they are henceforth regarded as cowardly and a deserter. In this place too, soldiers of Christ seem to be standing as if in a battle line against the devil: to abandon the fight and leave is not only inglorious but also dangerous. We must stay in this very place; so that by holding on to what we have, others do not take our crowns. We must stay and remain, so that by fighting gloriously here, sailing peacefully, we may live the safest life in spiritual pursuits and grasp eternal life, for which we have been called.

Our Savior speaks: "A city built on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, so it gives light to everyone in the house."
Matthew 5:14.
Therefore, it is fitting that such a bright lamp, originally placed under the basket of the monastery, is now transferred to the lampstand of the Church. This metaphorical basket aligns well with the monastery, where everything is done with careful measure. In the monastery, everything said or done is presented in the most equitable manner, adhering to the measure of the basket.
We can interpret the monastery through this spiritual metaphor. Like a basket, it contains nothing mixed within it. Just as wheat is separated from the chaff, the monastery receives those separated from the world. After the Lordâ€™s winnowing, which cleanses His threshing floor by ejecting the refuse outside, it keeps His chosen ones within as purer grains.
Just as the basket represents the monastery, the lampstand represents the Church. Being set in a visible or prominent place, it shows the light placed on it to everyone. A lit fire is meant to shine; hidden good does little, and hidden light shines little.
Exalt, most blessed bishop, proclaim your voice like a trumpet to the people from Heaven. Reveal the treasure you have unearthed in secret. Share the wealth you have amassed. Pour out openly to those who hunger the riches you have prepared in the wilderness, with the help of our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with God the Father and the Holy Spirit, forever and ever.
Amen.
