00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,887
Sermon on the Life of Saint Honoratus, Bishop of Arles

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:05,232
Introduction

3
00:00:05,232 --> 00:00:09,478
Dear friends, today is a day dedicated to the collective sorrows of the faithful.

4
00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:16,030
As long as the Lord grants me these fleeting days of life, this day will always be heavy with bitterness yet full of dignity.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,901
For today, the bishop of this Holy Church, Honoratus, a man of virtue and priesthood, has left his earthly body.

6
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,893
Anything I add might seem unnecessary.

7
00:00:23,893 --> 00:01:42,366
If I say, "He has gone to the stars," he was already counted among God's brightest stars while he was on Earth.
If I say, "He stands with Christ," when did he not stand with Him during his life?
His whole life embodied the voice of Elijah: "As the Lord lives, before whom I stand today" First Kings 18:15.
If I say, "He has left earthly things," remember, as the Apostle says, "his citizenship was always in heaven" Philippians 3:20.
Thus, whatever I might say about such a man seems insufficient due to his greatness.
Joy and sorrow are in conflict. It is sweet to remember such a man, but to be without him is a punishment.
Therefore, I am driven by a double motive. On one hand, the grace of his praises draws me to speak; on the other, the common losses pull me back to tears.
Forgive me if these two emotions tear my mind apart, making it difficult for my speech to serve both.
Whatever memory suggests in praise, sorrow claims entirely for itself among the losses. Even if I had a calm mind and my tongue served my mind properly, could his praise be expressed more abundantly by my words than it already is in your hearts?
I believe no one exists who does not see the grace of that man as greater than the most eloquent speech could express.
Therefore, as Scripture says, "The memory of the righteous is blessed" Proverbs 10:7. No one can remember men of illustrious merits without praise. So, I will share, as much as I can, some of the things that your loving hearts contemplate about him.

8
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:50,751
Your understanding will undoubtedly support my efforts, and whatever is difficult for my speech to express, your hearts will eloquently convey with their own thoughts.

9
00:01:50,751 --> 00:02:06,122
It is written: "Wisdom is praised at the end," which means the conversation of a wise person is praised at the end of the conversation. Hence, in another place: "Do not praise a person during their lifetime." And again: "Before death, do not praise anyone" (Ecclesiasticus 11:30); as if to say: Praise after death.

10
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:12,291
For in the praise of the living, space for vain exultation is offered to the praised, and flattery is attached to the praiser.

11
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:21,739
However, it is useful in many ways to praise the deceased: First, because when the one who could be gratified by praise is absent, it is necessary to attribute all praise to the giver of grace.

12
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,438
Then, because only the admiration of virtue remains, where the suspicion of flattery is removed.

13
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:32,705
Thus, the praise of the deceased, expressed in the holy assembly of the faithful, is full of edification and free from boasting.

14
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:36,964
The merits of the one praised also increase in this, as many benefit from their praise.

15
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:49,838
Nor will I fear that I may perhaps be believed to speak too favorably about my own, because besides the fact that nothing can be said inferior to his virtues, there is no one who does not consider him their own, has felt him their own, and believed him their own.

16
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:55,713
Yet, I do not attempt to describe the life of such a great man with confidence in my own talent or relying on eloquence.

17
00:02:55,713 --> 00:03:03,644
For if someone with the eloquence of old attempted it, not only would they not adorn it with rhetoric, but they would be overwhelmed by the weight of the subject.

18
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:08,000
Your love provokes me, your affection gives me the confidence to say something about him.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,085
The speech, though of lukewarm talent, will be inspired by his merits, and what is lacking in words will be elevated by the substance; and it will be flavored by the outpouring of your hearts' love for him.

20
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:24,311
Chapter One. The Nobility of Consular Honorati. A Young Man is Baptized.

21
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:35,345
It is well known to all who study oratory that, when praising someone's life, they first speak of their homeland and origin, so that any shortcomings in their virtues may be overshadowed by the glory of their ancestors.

22
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:40,332
But in Christ, we are all one, and the highest nobility is being counted among the children of God.

23
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:44,413
The honor of earthly origin adds nothing to our dignity except by being despised.

24
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:51,567
No one in heaven is more glorious than the one who, rejecting their ancestral lineage, chooses to be known solely by the fatherhood of Christ.

25
00:03:51,567 --> 00:04:01,542
Therefore, I omit mentioning his ancestral insignia and worldly honors, the nobility of his family, which was elevated to the rank of consul, but was scorned by him with a greater nobility of heart.

26
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:07,587
Nor did he take pleasure in his family's superfluous honors, as through the love of truth, he no longer desired his own.

27
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:32,324
My speech hastens to the point of how, with faith, he chose baptism in his youth,
how he wisely feared death with mature counsel,
how he foresaw he might be deprived of life before baptism,
how he longed for his life to be renewed with a deep thirst,
how sweet his childhood was,
how modest his boyhood,
how serious his youth was,
how he always surpassed all stages of age in grace and virtue, and was always found greater,
so that you would think he was raised by a certain divine pedagogy.

28
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:34,994
He was educated without any pressure from his family.

29
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:43,357
With God's help, he kept his baptism without any human concerns;
and, greater still, he turned to God with the fresh and unstained purity of the font without a guide.

30
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:50,561
Without a guide, I said;
and what about the obstacles from his homeland, the resistance from his father, the opposition from his entire family?

31
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:57,816
For grace had entered the minds of all;
and while Christ was taking him for Himself, the world eagerly held on to him through his entire family.

32
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:07,692
Some were drawn in by his sweetness, others captivated by the charm of the college, and still others held in admiration for the worldly virtues he displayed in various youthful activities.

33
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:12,627
As many graces as he had from his previous life, just as many chains held him back from conversion.

34
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:15,668
Everyone feared that the family's common honor would be lost.

35
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:18,809
And indeed, who ever saw that attire as anything but their own?

36
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:20,504
Which robes did he not once adorn?

37
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:25,938
Thus, his homeland, family, and parents all felt deprived of a most splendid gem and the common honor of all.

38
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:30,923
They believed these things were not to be changed for the better but were almost destined to perish.

39
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:42,389
Because his father saw that he pursued everything he undertook with vigor, he turned him away from baptism for as long as he could, fearing that he would be completely swept away by the love of religion, which eventually happened.

40
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:48,969
However, the desire and love for Christ grew stronger, and despite his father's evasions, his faithful childhood led him to baptism.

41
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:59,488
Even as a catechumen, he immersed himself in the first rudiments of faith, rejecting frivolity out of respect for baptism, honoring clerics as fathers, and sometimes helping the poor with his childish allowance.

42
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:09,259
Whatever he could possess at that age, and more so for the novelty of having it, he generously offered out of compassion: even then, in small things, contemplating giving away all his possessions.

43
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:13,846
With these and similar exercises, the robust faith of the catechumen rushed towards baptism.

44
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:32,191
Hence, his father, now cautious and concerned with earthly matters, tried to distract him with various entertainments, entice him with youthful studies, ensnare him with worldly vanities, and almost rejuvenate himself in a college with his adolescent son; keeping him busy with hunting and various games, and using all the sweetness of the world to subjugate that age.

45
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,825
Not without reason did his secular father fear losing him, whom he embraced as unique among distinguished youths.

46
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:41,614
But his greater concern among all these things was to safeguard his baptism.

47
00:06:42,312 --> 00:08:37,824
The young man despised what his elderly father enjoyed, always encouraging himself with these words:
"This life is delightful, but it deceives. Different teachings are recited in churches; different commands have sounded in my ears. There, modesty, self-control, peace, and shame are taught; here, unchecked indulgence is nurtured. There, piety thrives; here, physical exercise. There, Christ invites us to the eternal kingdom; here, the devil entices us to the temporary."
"Everything in the world is vanity and the lust of the eyes, and the world passes away along with its desires; but whoever does the will of God remains forever, just as He remains forever. Let us hurry to free ourselves from these snares while we are still less entangled. What has been bound for a long time is difficult to untie. It is easier to uproot something tender than to cut down something strong. Save your soul on the mountain, lest evil thoughts overtake you. The poison of pleasure spreads quickly; the freedom obtained through Christ's grace must be preserved."
"Others might admire gold and silver. Metals, as I see, control those who possess them. Others might own estates and slaves, not without the captivity of their own minds. Others might rejoice in honors and suppress the honor of the divine image in themselves: for me, it is enough not to be a slave to vices; for me, salvation is joy; for me, wisdom is my spouse; for me, pleasure is in virtues. For me, let Christ be the treasure who will exchange fleeting joys for better ones, and in this life, will allow me to be both entertained and adorned by the pursuits of discipline, and through these, to become worthy of the heavenly kingdoms."
This type of reflection did not lead to long delays; rather, the spark of conversion, fueled by such considerations, burst into flame immediately. Submitting his neck to the yoke of the Lord's service, he cast off the yoke of freedom, understanding that the highest form of captivity is youthful license. Luxuriant hair is cut short. The splendor of clothing is transferred to the purity of the mind. The beauty of a fair neck is covered by rough garments. Joy is transformed into serenity, and the vigor of the body is replaced by the vigor of the mind.

48
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:41,322
The strength of the body transfers into the strength of the spirit.

49
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:46,910
The beautiful face grows pale from fasting, and what was once full of vitality becomes full of seriousness.

50
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,641
And what more?

51
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:52,967
He suddenly appears completely different, so much so that his father mourns as if he had lost his son.

52
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:57,771
Truly, the mortification of the body is complete; but to him, it was the life of the spirit.

53
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:01,114
Consequently, the persecution from his parents is fully aroused.

54
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:09,573
For the first time, he was disobedient to his father, because he claimed to be the son of God the Father, already ordered in him, as Solomon commanded, with love.

55
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:14,847
For the prophet, under the voice of God, proclaims: "Set love in order in me." (Song of Solomon 2:4).

56
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:20,435
He indeed ordered it, and under the arrangement of love, he first looked to God, then to love his neighbor.

57
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,299
The old age of his father believed itself condemned by that change of age.

58
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:29,573
He confronted, resisted, and threatened; yet the boy, relying on God, was not shaken by any of these.

59
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:39,624
Chapter Two
Travels with Brother Venantius - His Death - Honoratus and Venantius Leave Their Homeland - Pilgrimages to Sacred Places.

60
00:09:39,624 --> 00:09:44,125
The Lord, the Comforter, assists His novice and raises up one of his brothers to join him.

61
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:51,028
Inspired by his example, and following his younger brother, in the short time they spent together, they shared both fellowship and virtue.

62
00:09:51,028 --> 00:10:30,095
This led to friendly competitions between them:
whose mind was more inclined to piety, whose food was tougher, whose speech was gentler, whose clothing was rougher;
who spoke less often and who prayed more frequently;
who spent less time in bed, who was more moved by reading;
who was less affected by injury, who was more moved by mercy;
who gave more readily what he had taken from himself;
who more willingly offered a guest a bed of sackcloth and a pillow of stone;
who more promptly comforted a stranger with tears before giving alms, and with love, fed Christ before the guest at the table;
whose mouth spoke less of the world, and more of Christ;
who, in the height of virtues, seemed smaller to himself, and the more he ascended by merit, the more he decreased in humility.

63
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:34,047
At that time, a certain private episcopate was conducted in their conversation.

64
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:46,302
I would be lying if I said many bishops did not learn from them, while being received, how to receive others:
for if any were not afraid of the rigor of their purpose, they took away more humanity in their souls than refreshment in their bodies.

65
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:54,105
Thus, they adorned the whole homeland at once, and as much as they remain in the minds of many, they preserved the bodies of some and the spirits of others.

66
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:59,507
As each one was in need, whether of clothing, teaching, or expenses, they were clothed, fed, and instructed.

67
00:10:59,808 --> 00:11:13,385
No one, weary from the journey, arrived there as if reaching their homeland and the fields of their inheritance; no one, departing from there to distant places, felt as if they were leaving their home again and leaving behind their fellow citizens and relatives once more.

68
00:11:13,385 --> 00:11:19,076
Meanwhile, the love for them grew among all people, multiplied, and spread, and their fame reached distant places.

69
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:22,620
The entire country was competing to show them respect, love, and honor.

70
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:28,759
It was impossible for them to fall into obscurity and poverty: the more their lives were hidden, the more their fame shone.

71
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,152
Each one tried to highlight and praise the other, attributing it all to a common virtue.

72
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:37,795
But while each one wished to be overshadowed by the other, the reflected light shone on both.

73
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:50,673
Their seriousness, mature wisdom, rare visits even from close women, and the avoidance of all vanity among so many virtues; how comforting their consolation, how careful their guardianship towards the safety of those who devoted themselves to their teaching!

74
00:11:50,673 --> 00:12:01,555
They led an angelic life on earth, with much patience, in vigils, in fasting, in chastity, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in gentleness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love, in the word of truth, in the power of God.

75
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:05,349
They feared their own glory and the widely spread fragrance of good conduct.

76
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:10,291
Although they attributed it to God's praise, they still feared the danger of vanity for themselves.

77
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:17,479
They believed they had received their reward in their lifetime, despising human interactions and favors, and they burned with love for solitude.

78
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:24,717
Therefore, after holding counsel and feeling as if they were enduring a kind of persecution of their honor, they resolved to go to foreign lands.

79
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:28,111
Once again, the homeland rose up and once again, relatives resisted.

80
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:31,306
They feared being deprived, but now more wisely, of their light.

81
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:34,151
What a battle of faith and love it was there, dear Jesus!

82
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:36,946
What consultations, what prayers, what tears were there?

83
00:12:36,946 --> 00:12:42,737
Who did not claim the duty of a relative for themselves, and whose tears did not compete with the tears of a father?

84
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:47,162
All the fathers felt that the nation was losing itself in those young men.

85
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:53,288
And truly, their old age was made honorable not by years, but by their virtues; not frail in body, but charming in character.

86
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:55,787
Oh, Lord, how great is the management of your care!

87
00:12:55,787 --> 00:13:01,618
You allow your lamps, burning with the fire of faith, to shine not just in one place but to illuminate various regions.

88
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:09,018
You inspire the desire to move and flee from glory, which certainly had to be multiplied by the very increase of virtue through the journey undertaken.

89
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:12,890
What was once shared through acts of mercy still remains abundant in substance.

90
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,006
Both relatives and strangers are equally admitted as auctioneers of the inheritance.

91
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:22,299
Thus, there is no regard for the parents' profits, as if they were selling something that was not their own.

92
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:28,424
The possession that had served the poor, since it had been held by them, is now being distributed and divided among the poor.

93
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:32,100
The nation receives the outpoured mercy and repays it with outpoured tears.

94
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,980
They leave their land, their house, and their relatives, showing themselves to be true sons of Abraham by their example.

95
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:49,006
However, to avoid any perception of youthful rashness, they take with them an elder of perfect and complete gravity, whom they always called father in Christ—the holy Caprasius, who still lived an angelic life on the islands.

96
00:13:49,006 --> 00:13:53,662
Although your love has not yet known his name or his life, Christ counts him among his friends.

97
00:13:53,662 --> 00:14:00,131
They take him as their guide in the Lord and the guardian of their age, whom many young people had already chosen as their guardian.

98
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:08,364
Therefore, a hiding place for their journey is sought, and the fame of their virtue is avoided; but wherever they go, whether they want it or not, another fame is born.

99
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:13,411
Fortunate lands and blessed ports, which the pilgrim, thirsting for the heavenly homeland, illuminates!

100
00:14:13,411 --> 00:14:20,174
Some go to the coasts of the East and other places full of saints to receive examples; these ones, wherever they go, awaken good examples.

101
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:25,662
Their substance is scattered everywhere, and in every place they approach, the good fragrance of Christ spreads.

102
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:35,505
This very person, whose memory nourishes us today, was almost taken by the Church of Marseilles for this city, urged on by the bishop of that city, and rejoicing in such a company.

103
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:39,310
But what could not that fervor of tears and ambition of flattery accomplish?

104
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:47,719
Therefore, more eagerly, warned by the new danger, they crossed the seas, seeking the shores where that Roman eloquence, which was abundant in them, would be barbarous.

105
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:58,080
It would take too long to recount the progress they made at each place they visited, the health they brought to the Churches without holding any clerical office, and how many teachers they silently mentored.

106
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:06,289
It is enough to remember that they endured the harshness of the sea for the love of Christ without fear, seeking the desolation and barrenness of the Achaean shore.

107
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:11,095
And so delicately, so gently raised, they struggled against such great changes of water and air.

108
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:19,854
How severe, how intolerable that would have been to their tenderness, the death of his blessed brother in Christ, Venantius, and his and his companions' infirmities testified.

109
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:26,812
Now what he believed he had either brought forth or received in that funeral at Methone, he indicated with the numerous throngs of singers.

110
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:33,319
Here the Hebrew, here the Greek, here the Latin exults, the Jew himself, rejecting Christ, admires the faithful servant of Christ.

111
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:40,677
The very stars are struck by the fervent choirs, and as we believe, angelic choirs sing along with human voices, Christ meets His faithful servant.

112
00:15:40,677 --> 00:15:53,091
Well done, Venantius, good and faithful servant; and while you hear, "Enter into the joy of your Lord," remember us who are still attacked by the pleasures of this world.
The struggles of flesh and soul come to an end; eternal life and glory begin.

113
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:54,583
Chapter Three.

114
00:15:54,583 --> 00:16:00,247
Honoratus, after his brother's death, comes to Italy and stays with the bishops.

115
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:02,512
Leontius, Bishop of Forum Julii.

116
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:04,707
He enters the island of Lérins.

117
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,925
Now Christ brings back Honoratus to you and with His hidden hand brings health through his return.

118
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:12,530
For whatever he touches in passing, he illuminates.

119
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,062
Italy rejoices at his arrival.

120
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:18,914
Tuscany embraces him with reverence and through its priests, weaves the most delightful delays.

121
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:28,618
However, God's providence, looking out for us, disrupted all plans, and the one who was drawn by the desires of the wilderness in his homeland, Christ invites to a wilderness near this city.

122
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:34,390
He seeks out a deserted island, made inaccessible by the fear of venomous animals, not far from the Alpine ridge.

123
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:41,847
Besides the opportunity for seclusion, he is delighted by the proximity and affection of the holy and most blessed man in Christ, Bishop Leontius.

124
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:44,707
Many others also try to pull him back with new ventures.

125
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:51,704
The surrounding inhabitants spoke of that terrible desolation, and in their zeal for faith, they vied to occupy him within their borders.

126
00:16:51,704 --> 00:17:13,922
But he, impatient with human interaction and longing to be cut off from the world by the sight of the sea, carried this in his heart and mouth, reciting to himself and his followers:
You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent Psalm Ninety-One Thirteen;
and in the Gospels, Christ's promise to His disciples:
I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions Luke Ten Nineteen.

127
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:18,416
Thus, he enters fearlessly, and dispels the fear of his followers with his own security.

128
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,685
The horror of solitude flees, and the crowd of serpents recedes.

129
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:23,881
What darkness did not flee from that light?

130
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:25,976
What poisons did not yield to his remedy?

131
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:39,243
Unheard of, truly, and clearly to be counted among his miracles and merits, is the fact that, despite the frequent encounters with serpents in those barren lands, especially stirred up by the sea tides, no one ever faced any danger, nor even fear.

132
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:40,620
Why should I delay further?

133
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:51,080
With Christ's help, overcoming all prior threats, Honoratus established some sort of camp of God there; and the place that had long repelled people from dwelling there became illuminated by angelic duties.

134
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,040
The hiding place is illuminated while the light is hidden.

135
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,989
The obscurity of the previously unknown exile gives way to the brightness of the voluntary exile.

136
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:01,030
What, then, does this improvement bring?

137
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,245
Wherever Honoratus goes, it is necessary for honor to be there.

138
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:12,511
Here first he is bound to the duty of the long-avoided cleric; here the priestly insignia adorns his reluctant head; and the dignity he had resisted comes to him.

139
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:21,287
There appeared a priest there, worthy of not only double but multiple honors, in front of whom no distance of priesthood, no privilege of the bishop's title was recognized.

140
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:25,675
No bishop ever claimed so much for himself as to consider himself that priest's equal.

141
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:31,696
But he preserved the monastic humility in priesthood as completely as the monk possessed the merits of the priesthood.

142
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:43,074
Through his industriousness, a sufficient temple of God's Church was erected there; suitable dwellings for monks rose up: waters denied for ages flowed abundantly, presenting two miracles of the Old Testament in one spring.

143
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:47,973
For when they burst forth from the rock, they flowed sweet in the midst of the sea's bitterness.

144
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:51,085
The entire region eagerly directed itself there, seeking God.

145
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:56,137
Whoever desired Christ sought out Honoratus; and indeed, whoever sought out Honoratus found Christ.

146
00:18:56,137 --> 00:19:00,780
For there he thrived entirely, his heart occupied like a lofty citadel and splendid temple.

147
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,423
There chastity, holiness, faith, wisdom, and virtue resided; there justice shone and truth.

148
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,787
With open arms and welcoming gestures, he invited everyone into his embrace—that is, into the love of Christ.

149
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:13,924
People flocked to him from all directions.

150
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:18,250
Indeed, is there any land or nation that does not have its citizens in his monastery?

151
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,828
What barbarity did he not tame?

152
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:22,474
How often did he turn wild beasts into gentle doves?

153
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:25,986
How many bitter behaviors did he soften with the sweetness of Christ?

154
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:31,228
Those whose wickedness was once torturous to themselves later found their grace brought delight to all.

155
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:35,706
Having tasted goodness, they could not help but increasingly despise what they had been.

156
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:40,948
It was as if they were brought into new light, hating the old prison of errors that had long held them.

157
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:44,511
Through his exhortation, various plagues of the soul were driven away.

158
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:51,788
Bitterness, harshness, and rage gave way to the freedom that Christ offered, and rest was delightful after long and heavy servitude to Pharaoh.

159
00:19:51,788 --> 00:20:01,559
A stupendous and admirable transformation, not by a cup of Circe turning men into beasts, but by the word of Christ, administered by Honoratus, turning beasts into men like the sweetest drink.

160
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,326
What could that constant effort combined with cheerfulness not accomplish?

161
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:08,277
Which stones would not be turned into children of Abraham?

162
00:20:08,277 --> 00:20:16,827
In such a workshop of virtues, where minds were refined, if he did not advance a person to their salvation with lively exhortations, he would compel God through prayer.

163
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:20,695
He took on everyone’s struggles as his own and wept as if they were his own.

164
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:23,392
He counted everyone’s progress and labors as his own.

165
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:31,332
Knowing how to rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep, he transferred both the vices and virtues of everyone into the sum of his merit.

166
00:20:31,332 --> 00:20:35,861
For as virtue excites virtue, so compassion bestowed on the miserable brings forth fruit.

167
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,965
He reaped more for each one than each one did for themselves.

168
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:41,612
The salvation of each person built up his one glory.

169
00:20:41,612 --> 00:20:46,752
Tireless, eager, and unwearied, he persevered, understanding the nature and character of each person.

170
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:55,760
He approached one discreetly, another openly; one sternly, another gently; and often changed his method of correction, sometimes even changing the very expression of correction.

171
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,512
From that point on, it was clear that we rarely saw anyone who was both so loved and feared.

172
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:09,216
He instilled these two emotions in his people in such a way that his love brought about a fear of doing wrong, and the fear of discipline fostered love.

173
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:13,072
Chapter Four The Excellent Teaching of the Lérins Monks.

174
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:17,548
The Virtues of Honoratus. Honoratus, Kind and Generous to Guests.

175
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:19,614
Eucherius Writes to Honoratus.

176
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:23,835
He cared deeply to ensure that no one was saddened or troubled by worldly thoughts.

177
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:29,000
He could easily discern what was bothering each person, as if he carried everyone's minds within his own.

178
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,067
With great care, he made sure that no one was overburdened with work or became lazy from too much rest.

179
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:36,724
He lovingly considered even the sleep of each brother.

180
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:41,840
He always stirred the physically strong from idleness and encouraged those with fervent spirits to rest.

181
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:48,924
He knew, I believe by God's inspiration, the strengths, spirits, and needs of everyone, truly becoming a servant to all because of Jesus Christ.

182
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:54,729
It's amazing how one person could fulfill so many duties at once, especially while suffering from various infirmities.

183
00:21:54,729 --> 00:22:00,338
He fasted and kept vigils with the strongest and those newly dedicated to monastic life, despite his own weakness.

184
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:05,552
He visited the sick, being weaker than them, and provided for their needs both spiritually and physically.

185
00:22:05,552 --> 00:22:18,638
He constantly thought about what each person needed: one might be cold, another troubled; this one's work is heavy; that food doesn't suit another; one was hurt by someone else; the offense given by one was severe, and the offense felt by another was equally severe.

186
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:27,543
It took great effort to achieve reconciliation, so one person might consider the insults they received as light or non-existent, while the other sighed for having caused great harm.

187
00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:48,106
His constant work and intention were to lighten the yoke of Christ for everyone, to ward off whatever the devil had instigated, to clear away the clouds of sin, to bring back the serenity of grace, to sow the love of Christ and neighbors by loving, and to nurture the minds of all as if they were his own heart; to renew their joys and always kindle a desire for Christ as if it were the first day of their conversion.

188
00:22:48,648 --> 00:22:55,502
From this, it was clear that the entire congregation, eager for divine service, gathered from different parts of the world in his name.

189
00:22:55,502 --> 00:23:00,123
Despite their differences in customs and languages, they were united in their love for him.

190
00:23:00,123 --> 00:23:05,810
They all called him Lord, all called him Father, considering him their homeland, relatives, and everything else.

191
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:09,771
They had all learned, with his compassion, to consider his pains as their own.

192
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:28,355
As the distinguished and blessed man in Christ, Salvian the priest, one of his dear friends, wrote in his works:
Just as the face of the sky changes with the sun's brightness or obscurity, so did that congregation, longing for heaven and devoted to heavenly pursuits, receive either the cloudiness or the clarity of minds from him, as if from a unique Sun in Christ.

193
00:23:28,355 --> 00:23:31,605
They would suffer when he suffered, and revived when he revived.

194
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:47,650
Therefore, it was, and still remains in its prayers, filled with the grace of the Holy Spirit in its monastery, strengthened by the example and admonition of such a great teacher, in various gifts of charisma, in humility and gentleness, in sincere love, and in the glory of the head in the diversity of its members.

195
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,834
He had great care for strangers and guests.

196
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,204
Who could ever pass by him?

197
00:23:51,204 --> 00:23:58,923
Who, regardless of how prosperous their voyage, did not immediately abandon their plans out of desire for this great man, a despiser of his own comfort?

198
00:23:58,923 --> 00:24:04,406
Or if they could not stay on the island, they considered the obedience of the second voyage a violent storm.

199
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:15,780
No one approached there without haste; no one felt their delays there; no one left there not feeling the greatest security, accompanied by his love, provisions, and prayers, sending them off as if they had long been his own.

200
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:23,245
In the desolation of the desert, he provided delights by his presence, welcoming everyone with such joy and love, as if he had been expecting them.

201
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:28,018
Furthermore, he matched his generous spirit with equal resources, ministered with equal faith.

202
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:33,705
For he who had gladly heard:
Sell all your possessions and give to the poor, and come, follow me
(Matthew 19:21)

203
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:39,785
Everyone eagerly brought whatever they had pledged in their hearts to give to charity for him to distribute.

204
00:24:39,785 --> 00:24:44,558
They entrusted everything to him with confidence, following his example of giving up everything.

205
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,436
This is why people frequently came to him from all over, from various regions.

206
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:56,143
And truly, he was not a stingy or timid steward who would give out little and keep more for himself, considering the growing congregation entrusted to him.

207
00:24:56,143 --> 00:25:00,469
But why wouldn't he do daily with others' resources what he had once done with his own?

208
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:05,838
That is, he kept nothing for himself or his followers, except for the food and clothing needed for that day.

209
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:10,015
Sometimes, the substance of his distribution was exhausted, but his faith never was.

210
00:25:10,015 --> 00:25:19,213
On one occasion, when there was only one gold coin left out of many thousands in the overflowing charity box, he gave that very coin to a poor person passing by, even amidst many needs.

211
00:25:19,213 --> 00:26:06,994
He said to me and others standing by, "It is certain that someone will come soon to bring more if our generosity has nothing left to give."
Barely three or four hours passed that day when someone arrived to confirm his words.
Oh, blessed generosity, served by faith!
Oh, blessed faith, never delayed by generosity!
Truly, as much as his faith provided, his own hand could not distribute.
He had many reputable men in various places whose hands he always used to distribute what was brought to him.
In this way, through the grace of a single distributor, he had many distributors, and his faith, like a common spring, flowed abundantly for many givers and receivers.
No hardship reached him that extended beyond him or didn’t find its end in him.
From then on, letters from everywhere eagerly reached him, as he thought, or at least as he hoped, that these letters, varied with new emotions, would bring him comfort.
How serious, how gentle, how sweet they were!

212
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:46,872
The most beautiful and splendid in the world, and even more splendid in Christ, the blessed Eucherius, a rival in virtue, received letters on wax-coated tablets from the nearby island where he resided in the desert:
"You have returned their honey to the wax," he said. Who then did not consider himself blessed, his home blessed, his writings blessed, enriched with a great blessing from such a small gift of his words?
Surely, there was so much wisdom and sweetness in his writings that they deserved to be stored not in chests or cabinets, but in the chest of one's heart. Many carry them inscribed in their minds and willingly share them as a testimony of their love. Finally, who ever had so many present friends bound by duty, as well as unknown ones who loved and eagerly desired him?

213
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:51,441
Chapter Five
Saint Hilary is converted by Honoratus' encouragements.

214
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:54,600
The effectiveness of Christ's grace in Hilary.

215
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:05,572
Meanwhile, as I recall his immense kindness to everyone, I cannot forget the special care he showed for me:
his guidance in Christ certainly led me to salvation, just as his love earned him your respect and affection.

216
00:27:05,572 --> 00:27:25,394
For my benefit, with his merit and my judgment in mind, he did not hesitate to return to the homeland he had once rejected;
nor did he avoid the arduous journey, which was especially challenging due to his many long-standing illnesses;
and there, finding me too attached to worldly matters and rebellious against God, he gently tried to guide me to the love of Christ with a persuasive touch.

217
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:37,580
It would take too long to detail the intensity of his encouragements, in which, having firmly set his mind on conversion, he could motivate himself with the strongest incentives, drawing deeply from the wells of wisdom and sharing it widely.

218
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:48,250
But since his pious words did not easily reach my ears, he turned to the usual supports of prayer, and the fervent cries of his affection, repelled by my stubbornness, reached and penetrated God's merciful ears.

219
00:27:48,250 --> 00:28:23,797
And truly, struggling against me and binding my sometimes dangerous worldly stubbornness with his sacrament, he prophetically promised me beforehand: "What you do not grant me, God will."
And oh, how long he strove to soften my hardness with a shower of tears!
How he vied with me in holy kisses and embraces for my salvation!
Yet for the present, as he said, I was defeated by a most wretched victory.
From there, God took me up to be disciplined and tamed by His right hand; for he had entrusted me to God through prayer.
What waves then stirred in my heart!
What storms of conflicting and opposing desires arose!
How often did my will and reluctance alternate within my mind!
And what more can I say?

220
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,598
In his absence, Christ carries out his will in me.

221
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:30,912
After two days, my stubbornness is subdued through his prayers by the mercy of God.

222
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:36,994
Thoughts had driven sleep away, and as my merciful Lord invited me, the whole world with its pleasures stood far off.

223
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:43,075
My mind was debating within me, as if discussing with a friend, what should be sought and what should be left behind.

224
00:28:43,075 --> 00:28:51,392
Thank you, good Jesus, thank you, who has broken my chains, moved by the pious supplication of your servant Honoratus, and placed on me the chains of your love.

225
00:28:51,392 --> 00:28:54,770
If I am held by them, the chains of sin will never prevail again.

226
00:28:54,770 --> 00:29:01,007
Therefore, I return submissive, who had left proud, and putting aside all contradiction, I approach as a new supplicant.

227
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:06,725
Thus, the prayer of the saints brings back their fugitives, subdues the stubborn, and conquers the rebellious.

228
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:11,663
Now, with what tears he then watered my dryness, how his pious weeping drew me also into tears!

229
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:16,237
With such humility and kindness, as if he were pleading with me himself, he received me.

230
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,576
The reason for delay was removed immediately.

231
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:23,566
Then, for the first time, he recognized that homeland which he had once believed should be fled.

232
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:27,048
He leads me out with him, his prize; he rejoices, triumphs, exults.

233
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:30,894
Yet already, by his example, he hastens to enclose me, eager for solitude.

234
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,649
First, he nourishes me with milk, and then with food.

235
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:39,055
He also gives me drink from that abundant source, which was within him, the heavenly fountain of wisdom.

236
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:43,057
And if only my spirit had received as much as he had strived to pour into me!

237
00:29:43,057 --> 00:29:51,062
He would certainly have prepared me for you, and given one worthy of your desire; and unknowingly, he would have trained a suitable successor for himself.

238
00:29:51,062 --> 00:30:00,366
Now truly, that overflowing love of his for all, let me say without envy, how much he added to me, and how much lighter he made that light yoke of Christ for me with his kindness!

239
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:03,900
How often he called my mind, how often my soul, how often my tongue!

240
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,162
How impatient of absence, how always eager for the sight of one so unworthy as me!

241
00:30:08,162 --> 00:30:13,308
What can I say about all this, except that prophetic saying, that the Lord has rewarded him for me?

242
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,220
Chapter Six. Honoratus becomes a bishop and lives episcopally.

243
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,864
Alms for the comfort of the dead.

244
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:26,298
Meanwhile, beloved ones, I am briefly touching on everything rather than fully recounting.

245
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:30,930
I have shared stories about your diligent shepherd that were known to others more than to you.

246
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:36,941
We have seen his priesthood in this Church enhanced by his name; but in sanctity and deeds, it was already supreme before.

247
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:40,538
But how is it, I ask, that he is sought from such a distance, so unknown?

248
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:44,134
Who planted the grace of an absent, never-before-seen man in your hearts?

249
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:50,244
Who stirred up the desire that, to those deprived of him whom the Lord had granted in the desert, he should be born for you?

250
00:30:50,244 --> 00:31:00,985
It was, of course, He who arranges all things; He who allowed him to his homeland as long as it seemed appropriate, and who led him across seas and lands for the benefit of those seeing this great grace of his servant.

251
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:06,997
In short, from the brief time he was introduced to you, it can be easily measured what more or less I have said about him.

252
00:31:06,997 --> 00:31:15,176
For you have seen, beloved ones, his vigilance of care, zeal for discipline, tears of piety, and constant, perpetual serenity of mind, evident in his unchanging face.

253
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:20,596
You also heard that mouth fitting to his life, with the corresponding purity of heart and eloquence of speech.

254
00:31:20,596 --> 00:31:33,800
You saw that breadth of charity, so great in him that the same saint, whose previous sentence I have quoted, rightly said about him: if charity itself were to be expressed by one’s own will, it would seem that it should be painted most of all on the face of Honoratus.

255
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,116
Who then ever thought they had seen him enough?

256
00:31:36,116 --> 00:31:38,678
Who did not find in him the place of all affections?

257
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:40,600
Who so joined gentleness with severity?

258
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,162
Who so offered a discipline mixed with cheerfulness?

259
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:46,315
Whom did he not correct with the joy of the one being corrected?

260
00:31:46,315 --> 00:31:48,582
When did his joy ever smell of any wantonness?

261
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:50,651
When did his sadness fail to be wholesome?

262
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:53,953
When did his groans descend, except from sorrow over another's sin?

263
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,412
Who didn't find him even greater after meeting him?

264
00:31:57,412 --> 00:32:01,245
Always at the height of his virtues, he continually found ways to grow more.

265
00:32:01,245 --> 00:32:04,322
Under his encouragement, who didn't set aside their own pain?

266
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,944
Who with wild habits didn't curse their own madness?

267
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:10,576
Who, being arrogant, didn't abhor their own pride more than anyone else?

268
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:13,501
Who, being lecherous, didn't despise their own indulgence?

269
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:14,207
And what more?

270
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:19,856
As the Apostle says, he became all things to all people First Corinthians 9:22, a universal remedy for everyone.

271
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:26,010
He possessed almost every grace in such fullness that it seemed he cultivated and possessed each one as if it were unique.

272
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:30,398
In no aspect of life did he not excel so much that he seemed particularly suited to it.

273
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:41,343
Furthermore, as soon as he took up the leadership of this Church of Arles, his first concern was harmony, and his primary effort was to unite a brotherhood still divided over the election of a bishop with mutual love.

274
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:46,487
As a proven leader of Israel, he knew well that nothing could easily be commanded to those in discord.

275
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:55,414
He preferred to govern with love rather than dominate with fear, so that voluntary correction would add this grace to his subjects, making them not seem compelled to their duty.

276
00:32:55,414 --> 00:33:00,156
Therefore, immediately excluding discord, he gave place to charity, the mother of all virtues.

277
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:04,594
Under him, the Church of Christ flourished, just as the monastery had flourished before.

278
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:12,563
It grew in grace and diminished in wealth; having entered discipline, it excluded the mammon of unrighteousness from its house as if it were the Lord's house.

279
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:21,894
What had been long accumulated idly, he finally assigned to worthy uses; he sent his treasures to the departed; and again, those who had offered felt the refreshment of their offerings.

280
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:24,416
He kept only what was sufficient for his ministry.

281
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:28,804
But if necessity had demanded it, I believe he would not have spared even the ministry.

282
00:33:28,804 --> 00:33:31,729
He made the wishes of another time his own administration.

283
00:33:32,688 --> 00:33:37,177
Chapter Seven. Honoratus's Illness, Death, Burial.

284
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:40,680
The Saints in Heaven Pray for Mortals.

285
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,147
Even in his final moments, he didn't stop working.

286
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:45,961
From his bed, he continued to enrich many with his words.

287
00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:51,094
But how long could that bed hold him, someone already used to pushing past the weariness close to death?

288
00:33:51,094 --> 00:34:01,114
On his last day, despite his pains, he delivered a sermon in the church on Epiphany, not realizing that his faith, battling infirmities, would succumb more to his spirit's fervor than to his body's pain.

289
00:34:01,114 --> 00:34:03,236
He served your desires beyond his strength.

290
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:15,032
No external illness overcame him, no sudden fever consumed him; rather, a prolonged weakness from his rigorous lifestyle, worsened by little relief, gradually wore him down around the eighth or ninth day after the aforementioned solemnity.

291
00:34:15,032 --> 00:34:21,301
Yet, for nearly four days, he continued to be present in acts of charity, fearing that his nearing end would sadden his people.

292
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:24,312
He was never a burden to anyone during his serious illnesses.

293
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,977
His ailments never horrified anyone, as often happens.

294
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:30,185
Indeed, in this way, that holy dwelling of the Spirit found rest.

295
00:34:30,185 --> 00:34:30,333
30.

296
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:34,627
However, it is incredible how the vigor of his pure mind remained intact until the end.

297
00:34:34,627 --> 00:34:43,660
He always abundantly consoled his people, fearing nothing more than that they would be overwhelmed by prolonged despair, understanding that the end is easier to bear than uncertainty.

298
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:49,830
He always wiped away the tears of those around him with his words, although the more he wiped away, the more he stirred them.

299
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,396
He considered their grief greater than his own pain.

300
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:57,085
No one endured such hardships with a braver heart, and he never wished for death nor feared it.

301
00:34:57,085 --> 00:35:03,650
For he, who did not tire of living in Christ's service amid any hardships, did not fear passing through that common door to new life.

302
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,211
Indeed, that final necessity of humans, which he had anticipated, did not come upon him suddenly.

303
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:15,163
With the end already in sight, as if he were departing and bidding farewell, he didn't want to leave anything incomplete.

304
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:20,131
He would question each of us and encourage us to suggest anything that might have escaped his memory.

305
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:24,263
Meanwhile, he would confirm everything with a signature, sparing us from tiring him.

306
00:35:24,263 --> 00:35:29,330
He urged us to take care of everything needing to be done, using his gentle authority as he always did.

307
00:35:29,330 --> 00:36:38,442
But on one occasion, as I struggled to hold back my tears, he said, "Why are you crying? Over the inevitable necessity of the human race? Should my passing find you unprepared when it has not found me unprepared?"
Through my sobs, I managed to say that I no longer mourned my own abandonment, as I was confident that the support of his prayers would never fail me; in fact, I presumed they would be even stronger after his passing. However, I was deeply afflicted by the pain and struggles of his final moments.
"And what," he said, "do I, the least of all, endure compared to what many of the saints have endured in their most bitter ends?" After recalling a few, he added something he had likely read somewhere, "Great men endure much, and they are born to be examples so that they may teach others to endure."
When the authorities, the prefect, and the officials gathered around him, he fervently delivered his commands, now under the chill of approaching death, taking the sharpest beginning of his exhortation from his very end. It was fitting that he, who had always provided examples in life, should also call upon his death as an example.
"You see," he said, "what a fragile dwelling we inhabit. However high we ascend in life, we are brought down by death. From this necessity, no honors, no treasures can redeem anyone. This is common to the just and the unjust, to the powerful and the humble."

308
00:36:38,688 --> 00:36:47,782
We owe a great thanks to Christ, who by His death and resurrection has filled our death with the hope of resurrection, offering eternal life and dispelling the terror of eternal death.

309
00:36:47,782 --> 00:36:53,466
So, live your life in a way that you do not fear the end of life; and view what we call death as a kind of journey.

310
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:56,283
Death is not a punishment if it does not lead to torment.

311
00:36:56,283 --> 00:37:09,035
The separation of body and soul is indeed harsh; but it will be much harsher for the body and soul to be together in the flames of hell, unless the spirit, recognizing its nobility throughout life, declares war on the body and struggles against bodily vices.

312
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:15,411
Happily separated from the corruption of the flesh by a blessed divorce, the spirit keeps both substances pure for eternal peace.

313
00:37:15,411 --> 00:37:25,296
They will be united there happily, where the saints will rejoice in glory and be glad in their bodies as in their proper places, recognizing the members they dedicated to justice as familiar lodgings.

314
00:37:25,296 --> 00:37:28,855
So, follow this path: this is the inheritance your Honoratus leaves you.

315
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:35,478
With his last breath, he invites you to the inheritance of the heavenly kingdom: Let no one be too attached to the love of this world.

316
00:37:35,478 --> 00:37:38,938
It is best to disdain by choice what you see you will inevitably lose.

317
00:37:38,938 --> 00:37:44,819
Let no one be overwhelmed by wealth, let no one serve money, and let no one be corrupted by the vain display of riches.

318
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:50,652
It is a crime to turn the price of salvation into a matter of destruction and to be ensnared by what could redeem you.

319
00:37:50,652 --> 00:37:55,841
Meanwhile, he advised more with his look, more with his eyes, more with his sense shining towards heaven.

320
00:37:55,841 --> 00:38:02,761
The speech of the one reporting is indeed unequal to his fiery speech; but the words of the one advising were no less unequal to his spirit.

321
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:08,890
With such exhortation and a certain unusual movement, he poured out his speech, imparting an extraordinary gift of blessing.

322
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,239
Though the service of his limbs was failing, the new grace of his mind always blossomed.

323
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:26,930
Therefore, with everything arranged (for not many things were left unfinished in his deeds), as he mentally went through all his dear ones, as many as his fatigue did not forbid him to name individually, he enriched them with a greeting sent through those who were standing by.

324
00:38:27,672 --> 00:40:11,160
In my ear, he said, "Excuse me, it could not be done for that holy one as he wished."
With great and admirable foresight, even amidst the severe sufferings of death, he ensured that he would not, as much as he could, leave anyone in sadness. He certainly left nothing without an excuse.
What about this, I ask: when his love had drawn all his friends to this city, he did not recommend any return or association to anyone, nor did he distribute specific places to live, as if foreseeing that none of his friends would be scattered, except those who had already departed from him in spirit while he was still alive.
And indeed, we truly know that hardly anyone leaves our company unless he himself predicted it, either having found his homeland dearer or the discipline too severe.
Meanwhile, a heavier sleep oppressed him, and when we sometimes interrupted him in fear, he said, "I am surprised that in my severe weariness, after such long sleeplessness, my sleep seems heavy to you."
And when, suspecting everything, we reported that he was sitting for a long time at the end, he responded with a joke, as he was accustomed to, with gentle and usual calmness of mind, that he tolerated us being troublesome in this part of our anxiety. Thus, almost before his life was consumed, his sweetness was.
Then, taken by his last sleep, he passed in slumber to the quiet of death without any struggle. He felt no difficult delays in his passing.
That holy, noble, sincere soul, uncontaminated by any contact with the world, is received by angelic choirs. Meanwhile, various visions appeared in the sleep of many, all having one aspect, namely that the offices of the saints met that holy one. And indeed, immediately at the same point in the middle of the night, the church filled up for the meeting of the holy body, so much so that it was thought he was awakened only by angelic messages.
His lifeless body, always lively in spirit and full of grace, remained. Indeed, the face kept its complete beauty, pleasing to all.

325
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,864
You know these things well and envision them more vividly in your minds than words can express.

326
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:19,181
No one seemed untouched by the loss if they missed seeing his body.

327
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:27,550
Out of respect or love, many kissed either his face, any part of his body, or the bier on which his carefully dressed body lay, almost naked as it was moved to the tomb.

328
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:34,086
Faith did not spare even the sanctified garments he wore, considering it a precious gift to have even a small piece of his clothing.

329
00:40:34,086 --> 00:40:36,463
Your affection was evident in his funeral rites.

330
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:41,910
You revived my hidden pilgrimage among you at his funeral and nourished me with your overflowing love for him.

331
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,643
Who stayed in their homes that day?

332
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:48,100
Or who wasn't drawn to the basilica's walls of this city, overwhelmed with personal grief?

333
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:52,309
It was considered a great honor to touch the bier or to place their necks beneath it.

334
00:40:52,309 --> 00:41:01,272
You witnessed his glory, and in doing so, shared in it: the respect for the funeral was a devotion of faith, as joyous to have had such a person as it was grievous to have lost him.

335
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:07,560
The honor of his tomb gives us great confidence, for we believe those whose bones we buried here offer us protection in heaven.

336
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:15,434
We saw the perfumes and incense presented before his bier, but God received even greater fragrances from your hearts, in your deep affection for such a pastor.

337
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:21,029
God's glory rejoiced in his glory, and in the diverse choirs of different languages, there was a harmonious love.

338
00:41:21,624 --> 00:41:27,015
Chapter Eight. Hilary, the successor of Honoratus, his relative.

339
00:41:27,015 --> 00:41:29,795
Honoratus is invoked as a patron.

340
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,262
The pious Lord, who stirred your hearts to elect me, granted that I would not be far from Honoratus's tomb.

341
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:38,682
He will also, as you pray, ensure that I do not stray from his ways.

342
00:41:38,682 --> 00:41:41,901
Whatever I learn he did, I will do without hesitation or debate.

343
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:45,070
For as I see, God already then prepared me for you through him.

344
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,082
Though unworthy, I was prepared for you.

345
00:41:47,082 --> 00:41:50,352
He sought me with such effort, without knowing me, for your sake.

346
00:41:50,352 --> 00:41:55,231
He educated me with eager concern and care, seeking a vein of faith in me as if in his own blood.

347
00:41:55,231 --> 00:42:03,832
With great effort, through letters and his journey, he strove to bring me back from the island where I had returned in secrecy, abandoning the beginnings of his bishopric.

348
00:42:03,832 --> 00:42:10,220
I do not dare to say if it was unknowingly or perhaps foreseen, so that he might place his homeland near his tomb in your love.

349
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,194
But what are we to do, as he handed me over immaturely by his mature departure?

350
00:42:14,194 --> 00:42:22,242
It is not for us to lightly blame the judgment of the eternal King:
you would not have easily felt what good you had lost if your good had been restored to you.

351
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:24,555
O great and illustrious Honoratus, your glory!

352
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:31,748
Your merit did not need to be proven by signs; for your very way of life, full of virtues and extraordinary novelty, provided a perpetual sign.

353
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:42,714
Indeed, we who were closer knew many things divinely granted to you; but you counted these as the least part, and it was a greater joy for you that Christ recorded your merits and virtues than that men noted the signs.

354
00:42:42,714 --> 00:42:46,838
And yet, what can be a greater sign of virtue than to shun signs and hide virtues?

355
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:54,685
Truly, your prayer was so familiar to Christ's ears that I believe it was granted by your earnest prayers that your virtue might not be proclaimed by signs.

356
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,863
Peace also has its martyrs; as long as you remained in the body, you were a perpetual witness of Christ.

357
00:43:00,863 --> 00:43:09,312
It is astonishing how the strength of your youth, continuously tempered by rigorous abstinence, was reduced to the thinness we saw—yet still maintained its grace.

358
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:17,604
This undoubtedly resulted from the daily cross you bore, without notable superstition, always avoiding excesses and the craving for glory that comes with them.

359
00:43:17,604 --> 00:43:21,515
On your lips, there was always talk of peace, chastity, piety, and charity.

360
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:32,676
In your heart, there was nothing but the source of all these virtues, Christ, who provided you and many others with the fruits of charity, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness, faith, modesty, and self-control.

361
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:41,385
These virtues overflowed in abundance for the salvation and joy of many, allowing you to rightfully sing: "Those who fear you shall see me and be glad" (Psalm 118:74).

362
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:53,902
You always credited all the good in your conduct to Him, constantly reminding yourself and others: "What do you have that you did not receive? And if you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?" (Second Corinthians 4:7).

363
00:43:53,902 --> 00:43:58,126
The more you denied the good of your life was yours, the more it was truly yours.

364
00:43:58,126 --> 00:44:01,151
You were a source of comfort for all who desired the Lord.

365
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:11,060
While some boast in the prosperity of this life, you advised rejoicing in God, your voice gently expressing your affection: "Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice" (Psalm 105:3).

366
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,241
Nothing brought you greater pleasure than prayers and psalms.

367
00:44:14,241 --> 00:44:22,742
Christ was so deeply rooted in your being that sometimes, even when your body was peacefully asleep, your tongue would still perform its usual duty in your dreams.

368
00:44:22,742 --> 00:44:27,070
Often while sleeping, you uttered words of sound exhortation and heartfelt prayers.

369
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:30,356
Indeed, while your body rested, your mind was active in Christ.

370
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:33,589
And truly, those of us who were present have experienced this.

371
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:39,051
But you, the one and only rest for everyone, how eagerly and often you recounted your dreams.

372
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:49,480
You weren't predicting anything or worried about the future; rather, you were stirred by the restless desires of your soul, particularly the desire for martyrdom, which you always carried in your thoughts.

373
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:56,398
Sometimes, I believe, you even jested about it, provoking your desire with the Lord, as if you were enduring persecution for your faith.

374
00:44:56,398 --> 00:45:01,282
And indeed, I believe no one would deny that you lacked torturers for martyrdom, not the spirit.

375
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:07,489
You were a daily witness in the most sincere discussions about the confession of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

376
00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:15,883
No one could easily discuss the Trinity of Divinity as expertly and clearly as you, distinguishing the persons and uniting them in the eternity and majesty of glory.

377
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:23,514
Therefore, remember, friend of God, remember us always, standing untainted before God, singing that new song, and following the Lamb wherever He goes.

378
00:45:23,514 --> 00:45:28,957
You are His follower; you are our patron, the acceptable interpreter of our prayers, and a strong advocate.

379
00:45:28,957 --> 00:45:32,112
Carry to your tomb the prayers of the flock drenched in tears.

380
00:45:32,112 --> 00:45:38,420
Obtain by common agreement that we all, both priest and people, may deserve to obtain some of what you commanded and taught.

381
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:45,746
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, who took you into His glory, and who lives and reigns with His Father and the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.

382
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:46,000
Amen.
