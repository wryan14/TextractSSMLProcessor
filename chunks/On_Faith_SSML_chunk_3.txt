    <s>532 ADMONITION concerning the following Chapter 45.</s> <s>No one can deny that the following chapter was not truly written by Fulgentius but was appended to this completed work by some unknown author.</s> <s>If you read Fulgentius’s book in its entirety, paying even moderate attention to the last words of the final chapter, you would see that after presenting 40 chapters or rules of true faith, Fulgentius mentions that the lack of time and the urgency of the messenger forced him to omit many things that should have been included.</s> <s>Thus, it is unlikely that he would have added this lengthy chapter, which contributes little or nothing to the work, or repeated the already concise rules in a shorter speech.</s> <s>Additionally, all the manuscripts we have seen, including four from the Vatican, two from England, and one very old manuscript from Corbie, which is over a thousand years old, almost dating back to Fulgentius’s time or the century following, do not include this chapter.</s>

            They omit what is read from the beginning, and at the end, after these words, "God will reveal this to them as well, Amen," it is written in the same hand, "The book of the Rule of True Faith by Fulgentius, Bishop of the Holy Catholic Church of Ruspe, ends here."
        </s>
        <s>
            But since it was a matter of religious duty not to exclude anything less than what was previously published, it seemed appropriate to attach this entire chapter to this work as a unique appendix.

        <s>
            1. Truly, the firm foundation of faith is primarily to believe that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are naturally one God.
        </s>
        <s>
            We believe that the only-begotten Son was truly born from the nature of the Father, and that the Holy Spirit truly and naturally proceeds from both the Father and the Son.
        </s>
        <s>
            We believe that this Holy Trinity is one, true, eternal, and unchangeable God.
        </s>
        <s>
            It is also fitting for salvation to believe that one person of the Trinity, that is, the only-begotten God, became human for our salvation.
        </s>
        <s>
            We believe that he is the one true God and true man, having one nature with the Father and the Holy Spirit in divinity, and, in humanity, having a rational soul of the same nature as all human souls, and flesh of the same nature as all who originate from the first human.
        </s>
        <s>
            Therefore, neither the soul nor the flesh of Christ is of the same nature as his divinity, because he was truly created according to his humanity.
        </s>
        <s>
            But just as his divine nature is common with the Father and the Holy Spirit, so his soul and body naturally share with our souls and bodies.
        </s>
        <s>
            By his divinity, he has freed the flesh and soul of believers in him from the power of sin and the punishment of eternal death by removing sin freely.
        </s>

        <s>
            2. Armed with this faith, do not forget to pray for divine mercy day and night, pleading for the blessed hope of all believers in him, who is Christ the Lord, so that you may hold firmly to the truth of this faith and keep it inviolate.
        </s>
        <s>
            The Holy Spirit provides abundant help to the faithful who pray, as the prophet says, "The Lord is near to all who call on him in truth. He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cries and saves them. The Lord watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy" (Psalm 145:18-20).
        </s>
        <s>
            And again, it says to God, "See, all who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you" (Psalm 73:27).
        </s>
        <s>
            But about himself, he says, "But as for me, it is good to be near God; I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge" (Psalm 73:28).

            3. Therefore, cling to God, dearest son, and place your hope in him with all your heart, faith, and love.
        </s>
        <s>
            Serve the earthly king faithfully in the service of the world, for this pleases God, as the Apostle commands.
        </s>
        <s>
            In matters of faith, by which Christ redeemed us with his blood, let all fear depart from our hearts.
        </s>
        <s>
            We owe our souls to him by whose blood we have been redeemed.
        </s>
        <s>
            We must love him above all, knowing him as the most merciful Redeemer of our souls.
        </s>
        <s>
            We must fear his eternal and true power above all, whom we hope to be the most just judge to come.
        </s>
        <s>
            We must yearn with all the affection of our hearts for his promises, who can grant eternal life to both soul and body.
        </s>
        <s>
            We must fear his wrath, who can cast both soul and body into hell: in whose judgment, without favoritism, without the ambition of power, masters and servants, kings and soldiers, rich and poor, humble and exalted, will be judged equally.
        </s>
        <s>
            Where any servant who has held the faith of God in truth will inherit the eternal kingdom, but the unfaithful master will be burned in everlasting fire.
        </s>
        <s>
            Where the life and joy of faithful servants and masters will not end, but according to the truth of the prophetic word, "Their fire will not be quenched, and their worm will not die" (Isaiah 66:24).
        </s>
        <s>
            For the wicked will go into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.

            4. Let us heed whom the Savior has foretold will go there, namely those to whom he will say, "I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me nothing to drink; I was a stranger, and you did not invite me in; I needed clothes, and you did not clothe me."
        </s>

  <p>
    <s>And you did not clothe me; a stranger, and you did not welcome me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit me (Matthew 25:42).</s> 
    <s>If the one who did not give bread to Christ in his hungry followers is rightly thrown into eternal fire, what will happen to the one who, through the sin of unbelief, denies himself the bread that came down from heaven?</s> 
    <s>And if the one who did not give a drink of cold water to Christ in his thirsty followers is burned in everlasting flames, what will happen to the one who, reborn from water and the Holy Spirit, allows himself to repeat holy baptism, which he received once for salvation and the sacrament of holy regeneration?</s> 
    <s>And if we believe that the one who neglects to welcome Christ in his wandering followers with charity is to be subjected to everlasting torment, what will happen to the one who, excluding the Lord Christ from the house of his heart and accepting the devil with blind unbelief, withdraws from the holy Church, which is the pillar and foundation of truth (1 Timothy 3:15), surrounded by heretical falsehood?</s> 
    <s>And if the one who does not visit the sick and imprisoned servants of Christ is destined for eternal fire, what shall we say is deserved by those who violently afflict the servants of God, in whom they persecute only the truth of faith, either by the squalor of prisons or by the deportation of exiles?</s> 
    <s>But in all these things, although the unbelievers rage, God provides help to his own.</s> 
    <s>And while the enemies of faith desire to corrupt anyone either by cunning seduction or by violent coercion, Christ, who is the power and wisdom of God, grants strength so that they may despise the promises of deadly persuasion and withstand human terrors with the strength of divine fear:</s> 
    <s>it is only necessary that the will is not turned away from God, and the reward of faith is obtained.</s> 
    <s>For it is the same will for which either eternal punishment is inflicted for unbelief, or everlasting joy will be the reward for kept faith.</s>
