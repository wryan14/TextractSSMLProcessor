      I received your letter, dear Peter, in which you mentioned your desire to go to Jerusalem and asked for guidance on how to maintain the true faith there.

    <s>
      You wanted to ensure that no heretical ideas could deceive you.
    </s>
    <s>
      I am glad that you are concerned about preserving the true faith without any taint of falsehood because without faith, no conversion can be beneficial or even possible.

      As the apostolic authority states, "without faith, it is impossible to please God" (Hebrews 11:6).

      Faith is the foundation of all good things.

    <s>
      It is the beginning of human salvation.

    <s>
      Without it, no one can become a child of God.

    <s>
      Without faith, no one receives the grace of justification in this world nor eternal life in the next.

    <s>
      If someone does not walk by faith here, they will not reach the vision of God.
    </s>
    <s>
      Without faith, all human effort is in vain.
    </s>
    <s>
      Trying to please God without true faith is like someone aiming for a blessed homeland, but abandoning the right path and instead following a misguided route, leading to a fall rather than joy.

      However, to speak sufficiently about faith, we lack the time because you desire a swift response, and the task is so great that it can scarcely be fulfilled even with extensive discussions.

      You did not ask to be guided against any specific heresy but requested a general definition of faith, to be explained briefly.

      Clearly, it is impossible to fully cover such a vast topic in a short time, even if we had the time and ability to compose many volumes on what you seek.

      But because God is near to all who call upon Him in truth...
    </s>

  <p>
    <s>The Lord is near to all who call on Him (Psalm 145:18), completing and shortening His word on earth (Romans 9:28).</s>
    <s>I hope that, just as He has granted you holy concern for this faith, He will also give me enough ability to serve your good and praiseworthy desire.</s>
    <s>Even if I can't say everything that exposes and refutes every heretical error, I will, with the help of the Holy Trinity—who is the one true and good God—speak at least enough to clearly present the core of the Catholic faith without any shadow of error.</s>
    <s>By keeping these truths, you will also be able to recognize and avoid those errors that, even if not specifically refuted in this work, will become clear from what is generally and absolutely stated here.</s>
    <s>These errors are not handed down by the rule of divine truth but are the inventions of human wickedness whispered into the ears of the faithful by unbelievers.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Chapter 1</s>
    <s>No matter where you are, remember that according to the command of our Savior, you were baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</s>
    <s>Hold firmly and undoubtedly in your heart that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God—that is, the holy and ineffable Trinity is naturally one God.</s>
    <s>As it says in Deuteronomy: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God is one Lord" (Deuteronomy 6:4).</s>
    <s>And, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve" (Deuteronomy 6:13).</s>
    <s>However, because this one God—who alone is naturally true God—is not just the Father alone, nor the Son alone, nor the Holy Spirit alone, but the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit together, we must be careful not to confuse their distinct persons.</s>
    <s>We must not say or believe that the Father is the same as the Son or the Holy Spirit, or that the Son is the same as the Father or the Holy Spirit, or that the Holy Spirit is the same as the Father or the Son.</s>
    <s>This understanding is essential in the confession of the Trinity and must not be violated.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>The faith that the holy patriarchs and prophets received divinely before the incarnation of the Son of God, and which the holy apostles heard from the Lord Himself and were instructed by the Holy Spirit, proclaimed one God in Trinity, that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</s>
    <s>However, the Trinity would not be true if the same person were called Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</s>
    <s>If the substance of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit were the same, but their personhood were not distinct, then the Trinity would not truly be the Trinity.</s>
    <s>Moreover, the Trinity would not be true if the one God were not Himself the Trinity, but if the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit were distinct in nature as well as person.</s>
    <s>However, in the one true God, the Trinity is not only true because God is one, but also because the Trinity is naturally true.</s>
    <s>Therefore, the true God is a Trinity in persons and one in nature.</s>
    <s>Through this natural unity, the Father is entirely in the Son and the Holy Spirit, and the Son is entirely in the Father and the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is entirely in the Father and the Son.</s>
    <s>No one of them exists outside the others because none precedes the others in eternity, exceeds in greatness, or surpasses in power.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>The Father is not greater than the Son, nor the Holy Spirit, when it comes to the unity of the divine nature, nor is He prior or greater.</s>
    <s>Neither can the eternity and immensity of the Son naturally precede or exceed the eternity and immensity of the Holy Spirit.</s>
    <s>Just as the Son is not lesser or later than the Father, the Holy Spirit is not lesser or later than the Son.</s>
    <s>Eternal and without beginning is the Son who was born from the nature of the Father, and eternal and without beginning is the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the nature of the Father and the Son.</s>
    <s>Therefore, we rightly believe and say that the three are one God, because there is one eternity, one immensity, and one divinity of the three persons.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>So, let's hold that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are naturally one God.</s>
    <s>However, the Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Father, and the Holy Spirit is not the Father or the Son.</s>
    <s>The essence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is one, which the Greeks call <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="uːˈsiː.a">οὐσία</phoneme>.</s>
    <s>In this essence, the Father is not different from the Son or the Holy Spirit, though personally, the Father is different from the Son, and the Son is different from the Holy Spirit.</s>
    <s>This is clearly shown to us in the very beginning of the Holy Scriptures, where God says, "Let us make man in our image and likeness."</s>
    <s>When He says "image" in the singular, He shows that there is one nature in whose image man would be made.</s>
    <s>But when He says "our" in the plural, He shows that the same God, in whose image man would be made, is not one person.</s>
    <s>If in that one nature of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit there were one person, He would not have said, "in our image," but "in my image"; nor would He have said, "let us make," but "let me make."</s>
    <s>If in those three persons there were three substances to be understood or believed, He would not have said, "in our image," but "in our images," for one image of three unequal natures could not be.</s>
    <s>But when man is said to be made in the image of one God, the essential divinity of the Holy Trinity is intimated.</s>
    <s>Then, shortly after, for what God had said above, "Let us make man in our image and likeness," Scripture narrates that man was made, saying, "And God made man: in the image of God, He made him."</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>The prophet Isaiah did not remain silent about this revelation of the Trinity of persons and unity of nature.</s>
    <s>He says he saw the Seraphim crying out: "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts."</s>
    <s>Where in the repetition of "Holy" three times, we recognize the Trinity of persons, and in the single mention of "Lord God of hosts," we acknowledge the unity of the divine nature.</s>
    <s>In that holy Trinity, which we repeat often to impress it more deeply upon your heart, there is one Father who alone essentially begot one Son from Himself; and one Son, who alone is essentially born from one Father; and one Holy Spirit, who alone essentially proceeds from the Father and the Son.</s>
    <s>This cannot all be done by one person, that is, to beget Himself, to be born from Himself, and to proceed from Himself.</s>
    <s>Because to beget is different from being born, and to proceed is different from begetting or being born, it is clear that the Father is different, the Son is different, and the Holy Spirit is different.</s>
    <s>Thus, the Trinity refers to the persons of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and the unity refers to the nature.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Just as in that divinity where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one, we don't believe the Father was born, nor the Holy Spirit, but only the Son.</s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>According to the flesh alone, the Catholic faith both believes and proclaims that the Son was born.</s> 
<s>For in that Trinity, it is unique to the Father alone that He was not born, but He begot the one and only Son.</s> 
<s>And it is unique to the Son alone that He did not beget, but was born solely from the Father's essence.</s> 
<s>And it is unique to the Holy Spirit that He was neither born nor begot, but proceeds solely from the Father and the Son.</s> 
<s>If, according to the divine nature, God the Father was not born of any God, yet according to the flesh, He was born of a virgin.</s> 
<s>For if the Father were born of a virgin, the Father and the Son would be one person.</s> 
<s>But that one person, because He was not born of God but only of a virgin, would truly be called not the Son of God, but only the son of man.</s> 
<s>Nor would He be called the Son of God.</s> 
<s>Thus, God loved the world so much that He gave His only begotten Son.</s> 
<s>And again: God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but to save the world through Him.</s> 
<s>Nor would the blessed John have said: Whoever loves the Father loves the one born of Him.</s> 
<s>Nor would the Son Himself have said: My Father is still working, and I am working.</s> 
<s>For He who is called the Son, if He were the same as the Father, would not truly be called the Son of God, because He would be born not of God but only of a virgin.</s> 
<s>Finally, the Father Himself would not testify from heaven and show His Son with a physical voice, saying: This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.</s> 
<s>Nor would the Apostle Paul have said of God the Father: He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>But because all these things were said by divine inspiration for our teaching, and because they are divine words, they are certainly true.</s> 
<s>It is true that the Catholic faith preaches and believes that the only Son is eternally born of the Father, immortal, impassible, and unchangeable God.</s> 
<s>And according to the flesh, not the Father, but His only begotten Son was born in time, preserving His eternity, suffered, preserving His impassibility, died, preserving His immortality, and was truly raised, preserving His unchangeability.</s> 
<s>He shares everything with the Father that He eternally had by nature without beginning.</s> 
<s>And He shares nothing with the Father of those things that the eternal and exalted One humbly and temporally took upon Himself.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Again, if it were not the proper and only begotten Son of God the Father who was born of a virgin, but the Holy Spirit, the Church would not believe in her heart for righteousness and confess with her mouth for salvation the Son who was made of a woman, made under the law, born of the Holy Spirit from the Virgin Mary.</s> 
<s>But if the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of the Father and the Son, took the form of a servant, the Holy Spirit Himself would not come upon the man made in the form of a dove from heaven.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Therefore, God the Father, begotten of no God, once begot His Son God from His own nature without beginning, equal to Himself in the same divinity by which He is naturally eternal.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>But the same Son of God, being eternal and true God,</s>
    <s>and one God with the Father according to divinity,</s>
    <s>as He says: "I and the Father are one" (John 10:30),</s>
    <s>became a true and complete man for us.</s>
    <s>He is true because He, that God, truly has human nature;</s>
    <s>He is complete because He took on human flesh and a rational soul.</s>
    <s>The same only-begotten God was born twice:</s>
    <s>once from the Father, once from the mother.</s>
    <s>He was born from the Father as the Word of God,</s>
    <s>and born from the mother as the Word made flesh.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, the same Son of God was born before all ages and was born in this world;</s>
    <s>both births belong to one Son of God:</s>
    <s>divine, by which the creator in the form of God is co-eternal with the Father;</s>
    <s>human, by which He humbled Himself and took the form of a servant,</s>
    <s>forming Himself not only in the conception of the maternal womb while becoming man,</s>
    <s>but also coming forth from the same maternal womb as God made man,</s>
    <s>and hanging on the cross as God made man,</s>
    <s>and lying in the tomb as God made man,</s>
    <s>and rising from the dead on the third day as God made man;</s>
    <s>but in the tomb according to the flesh only did God lie,</s>
    <s>and descended into hell according to the soul only.</s>
    <s>On the third day, when the soul returned from hell to the flesh,</s>
    <s>the same God rose from the tomb in the flesh that lay in the tomb;</s>
    <s>and on the fortieth day after the resurrection,</s>
    <s>the same God made man ascended into heaven and sat at the right hand of God,</s>
    <s>from there to come at the end of the world to judge the living and the dead.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, the Word made flesh is the one Son of God,</s>
    <s>our Lord Jesus Christ, mediator between God and men.</s>
    <s>He is the mediator because He is both true God and true man,</s>
    <s>having one divine nature with the Father and one human substance with the mother;</s>
    <s>having from us, even to death, the penalty for our iniquities;</s>
    <s>having unchangeable justice from God the Father;</s>
    <s>temporarily dead because of our iniquity,</s>
    <s>but eternally alive because of His justice,</s>
    <s>and granting immortality to mortals.</s>
    <s>He preserved His perfect humanity in the perfection of His divinity;</s>
    <s>and through accepting death,</s>
    <s>He absorbed the truth of His mortality with the truth and unchangeability of His immortality.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>This is what the blessed Peter testifies,</s>
    <s>that Christ swallowed up death so that we might become heirs of eternal life (1 Peter 3:22).</s>
    <s>Blessed Paul also teaches that Christ swallowed up death,</s>
    <s>and illuminated life and incorruption (2 Timothy 1:10).</s>
    <s>Christ tasted death because He is true man;</s>
    <s>and swallowed up death because He is true God.</s>
    <s>As the Apostle says, He died due to weakness,</s>
    <s>but lives by the power of God (2 Corinthians 13:4):</s>
    <s>the same one who, according to the prophecy of blessed David,</s>
    <s>was made man in Zion,</s>
    <s>and He, the Most High, established it (Psalm 87:5).</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, the divinity of Christ is not different from the nature of the Father,</s>
    <s>as in the beginning was the Word,</s>
    <s>and the Word was with God,</s>
    <s>and the Word was God.</s>
    <s>This was in the beginning with God.</s>
    <s>All things were made through Him,</s>
    <s>and without Him nothing was made (John 1:1);</s>
    <s>nor is His humanity different from the nature of His mother.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    Because the Word was made flesh and lived among us. That nature which is always born from the Father took on our nature without sin, to be born from a virgin. For the eternal and divine nature could not temporally be conceived and born from human nature at all, unless the ineffable divinity had accepted in itself a true temporal conception and birth according to the assumption of human truth. Thus, God is eternal and true, truly conceived and born from a virgin in time. When the fullness of time came, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law, so we might receive adoption as sons. This God who became naturally the Son of Man is the same as the one who is naturally the Son of God the Father. John the Evangelist confirmed this when he said, "The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us," and then added, "We have seen His glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth." So, He, the creator and Lord of all spirits and bodies, that is of all natures, created the virgin from whom He was to be born; and made His mother, the one whose flesh He was to take on to be conceived and born as true flesh. Thus, according to the truth of the servant's form, God mercifully became man, and according to the form of God, He, remaining the same God-Man by natural truth, did not lack.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So, believe that Christ, the Son of God, one person of the Trinity, is true God, without doubting that His divinity is born from the Father's nature. And believe that He is true man, not thinking that His flesh is of a heavenly, airy, or any other nature, but of the same nature as all human flesh: which God Himself molded from the earth in the first man and creates in other humans through propagation. But although the flesh of Christ and all humans is of the same nature, this flesh that God the Word deigned to unite to Himself from Mary the Virgin was conceived without sin and was born without sin: as the eternal and just God was mercifully conceived, born, and crucified as the Lord of glory.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The desire of intercourse. How can we explain the unique excellence of that flesh, which has a divine person from its very conception, whose origin of birth was unusual, in which the Word was made flesh, so that the only begotten and eternal God was one person with His flesh, conceived by His own flesh's conception. The flesh of other humans is known to be born through human intercourse, with a man sowing and a woman conceiving and giving birth. And because when man and woman unite to generate children, the intercourse of parents is not without lust, it follows that the conception of children born from their flesh cannot be without sin, where sin is transmitted to infants not by propagation but by lust; the fertility of human nature does not create humans with sin, but the foulness of lust, which humans have from the just condemnation of that first sin. Therefore, blessed David, although born of a lawful and just marriage, in which neither the guilt of infidelity nor the stain of fornication could be found, exclaims because of original sin, to which the children of wrath are naturally bound, not only the children of the impious but also all who are born from the sanctified flesh of the just.
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>Look, I was conceived in sin, and my mother gave birth to me in sin.</s>
    <s>Even holy Job says that a person cannot be clean from filth, not even if their life on earth is just one day.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, the only begotten Son of God, who is in the bosom of the Father, took on human flesh and a rational soul to cleanse them.</s>
    <s>He, who is truly God, became truly human, not to be a different God or a different human, but the same God and the same human.</s>
    <s>To remove the sin that human generation contracted in the act of mortal flesh, He was conceived in a new way.</s>
    <s>God was incarnated in a virgin mother without a man's involvement, without the virgin's desire, so that through God as a human, conceived without lust and born from a virgin's untouched womb, the sin that all humans inherit at birth would be washed away.</s>
    <s>Because in this mortal body, mothers cannot fulfill the work of fertility without first losing their bodily virginity.</s>
    <s>Only the only begotten God removed the sin of human conception and birth, as He took on true flesh from a virgin when He was conceived, and preserved her virginity when He was born.</s>
    <s>This is why God became the son of the virgin Mary, and Mary, a virgin, became the mother of the only begotten God.</s>
    <s>The one whom the Father begot from eternity, the virgin conceived and brought forth in time.</s>
    <s>Indeed, God, who was to be born from her, filled her with special grace so that she would have the fruit of her womb, who is the universal Lord from the beginning.</s>
    <s>She saw Him subjected to the solemnity of birth, whom in the unity of the Father's substance, not only human but also angelic creatures know and adore as the Most High.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Thus, the sin and punishment of sin that entered the world through the crime of a corrupted woman are removed from the world through the birth of an inviolate virgin.</s>
    <s>And since, in the condition of the human race, by a woman made from a man alone, we were bound by the chain of death, divine goodness acted in the redemption of the human race so that life was returned to humans through a man born of a woman alone.</s>
    <s>There, the devil joined human nature to himself in the likeness of sin through wicked deception; here, God united human nature to Himself in the unity of His person.</s>
    <s>There, a woman was deceived to become the daughter of the devil; here, a virgin was filled with grace to become the mother of the highest and unchangeable only begotten God.</s>
    <s>There, an angel cast down by pride obtained the mind of the deceived woman; here, God, humbling Himself through mercy, filled the womb of the incorrupt virgin from whom He was to be born.</s>
    <s>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was in the form of God, could not be unless He was born from the nature of the Father.</s>
    <s>According to apostolic teaching, He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant.</s>
    <s>Therefore, God took the form of a servant, that is, the nature of a servant, into His own person, and thus the maker of humans was made in the likeness of humans, and was found in human form.</s>
    <s>He humbled Himself, becoming obedient to the Father unto death, even death on a cross.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, carefully consider this statement of the Apostle, and in it, you will understand how to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the same God and human.</s>
    <s>However, do not confuse or divide the truth of both natures in one person.</s>
    <s>When you first hear about the Lord Jesus Christ being in the form of God, you must recognize and firmly hold that the name "form" signifies natural fullness.</s>
    <s>Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ was in the form of God because in...</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    The nature of God the Father was always there, from whom the Son was born. Therefore, He shares the same nature with the Father, equally eternal and boundless, equally immortal and unchanging, equally invisible and indescribable, equally good and just, equally compassionate and merciful, patient and very merciful and truthful, equally strong and gentle, equally wise and all-powerful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, hold firmly with the strongest faith to all these things we have said about the Son of God, because having all these things in unity of nature with the Father, He is undoubtedly equal to the Father. For this reason, the Apostle immediately adds, saying: "He did not consider it robbery to be equal with God" (Philippians 2:6). It was not as though the Son's equality in divinity with the Father was stolen, but it was by nature. Even what the Apostle subsequently adds, saying that He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and found in fashion as a man; and that He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even death on the cross; all these things about that only-begotten God, the Son of God, about that Word of God of whom the evangelist says: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1); about that power and wisdom of God, of which it is said to God: "You have made all things in wisdom" (Psalm 104:24); about that principle with which the Father Himself is one principle, and in which He made heaven and earth, that is, all spiritual and physical nature; about the only-begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, as I said, take all these things personally: yet preserving the eternity, immensity, immortality, unchangeability, and invisibility of His divinity. These attributes the Son of God naturally and equally shares with God the Father, so that although He truly became man for us, He remained equal to the true God the Father, from whom He was born as true God and Truth. He emptied Himself, but from His fullness, we have all received (John 1:16): because if He had lost His fullness when He emptied Himself, He would certainly not have had anything to give to us from it. But since He retained it, we could undoubtedly receive from His fullness. Therefore, He took the form of a servant: for the emptying of the supreme God was nothing else but the acceptance of the form of a servant, that is, human nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, both forms are in Christ, because both the divine and human natures are true and complete in Christ. Therefore, the holy Evangelist proclaims Him full of grace and truth (John 1:14), because He is full in the divine nature in which God is Truth; and He is full in the human nature in which the true man is made by grace. In that fullness, He is God, in the form of God equal to God; in this fullness, He is a servant, in the form of a servant, because being made in the likeness of men, He was found in fashion as a man. Therefore, emptying Himself, He took the form of a servant to become a servant; but He did not lose the fullness of the form of God, in which He is always the eternal and unchangeable Lord: He became a true man according to the form of a servant, of the same nature as His servant mother; and remaining in the form of God, He is the true God of the same nature as His Lord Father. In the form of God, He is one with the Father and the Holy Spirit as the sole Creator of all things; according to the form of a servant, He alone was formed by His own and the Father's and the Holy Spirit's operation: what He is as Creator, He naturally shares with the Father and the Holy Spirit; what He is as created, according to the form of a servant in which He was created.

    These things are missing from all the manuscripts, which is not inappropriate. He alone has it personally within himself.

    <s>For even in the sacrifices of carnal victims, which the Holy Trinity itself, who is the one God of the New and Old Testament, commanded our ancestors to offer, the most pleasing gift of that sacrifice was signified, by which the Son of God alone, according to the flesh, would mercifully offer himself for us.</s> <s>For he, according to apostolic teaching, offered himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God in a fragrant aroma (Ephesians 5:5).</s> <s>He is the true God and the true high priest, who entered the holy place not with the blood of bulls and goats, but with his own blood once and for all (Hebrews 9:12).</s> <s>This was symbolized by that high priest who entered the Holy of Holies with blood every year.</s> <s>Therefore, he is the one who exhibited in himself everything necessary for our redemption: the same priest and sacrifice, the same God and temple—priest, by whom we are reconciled; sacrifice, by which we are reconciled; temple, in which we are reconciled; God, to whom we are reconciled.</s> <s>However, he is the only priest, sacrifice, and temple, because all these things are of God according to the form of a servant, not only of God, because this is with the Father and the Holy Spirit according to the form of God.

    <s>So, principally, hold that all nature (or creation) that is not the Trinity God is created from nothing by the Holy Trinity, who is the one true and eternal God.</s> <s>And thus, all things in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, or Powers, are the work and creation of the Holy Trinity, who is the one God, the creator and Lord of all things, eternal, omnipotent, just, and good, naturally having it so that he always exists and cannot change.</s> <s>And this God, who is always without beginning because he is supremely existent, gave to the things created by him to exist, but not without beginning, because no creature is of the same nature as the Trinity, the one true and good God, by whom all things were created.</s> <s>And because he is supremely good, he gave to all natures (or things) that he made to be good, but not as good as the creator of all good things, who is not only supremely good but also the highest and unchangeable good, because he is the eternal good, having no defect because he was not made from nothing, having no progress because he has no beginning.</s> <s>Therefore, creatures made by God can progress because they began to exist; they can also fail because they were made from nothing.</s> <s>Their condition of origin leads them to defect; the operation of the Creator leads them to progress.</s> <s>Therefore, in the first place, the eternity of the Trinity, who is the true God, is naturally recognized without beginning, because he made certain things so that, although they began to exist, they can never cease to exist.</s> <s>His omnipotence is understood in this, because he created everything.

  <p>
    <s>He made both the visible and invisible, that is, the physical and spiritual, out of nothing.</s> 
    <s>This diversity of things greatly highlights the goodness and omnipotence of the Creator.</s>
    <s>For if He were not omnipotent, He would not have made both the highest and the lowest with the same ease.</s> 
    <s>And if He were not supremely good, He would not have cared for even the lowest things.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Heavenly and earthly bodies differ.</s> 
    <s>Therefore, in both great and small created things, the greatness of the Creator's goodness and omnipotence is evident.</s> 
    <s>For He made everything wisely with supreme and true wisdom.</s> 
    <s>To Him, being is the same as being wise, and doing is the same as doing wisely.</s> 
    <s>Thus, the simplicity of God's manifold wisdom commends the greatness of His majesty, not only in the magnitude of the highest creatures but also in the smallness of the lowest ones.</s> 
    <s>All the good things He created are not only far inferior and dissimilar to their Creator, since they were not derived from Him but made entirely from nothing, but they also vary among themselves.</s> 
    <s>Each thing remains as God made it to be: some in one way, some in another.</s> 
    <s>For it was not given to bodies to exist in the same way that spirits were given existence.</s> 
    <s>Even bodies themselves are not equal, and among the heavenly and earthly bodies, there is also some diversity.</s> 
    <s>Both heavenly and earthly bodies differ not only in size but also shine with different brightness.</s> 
    <s>As the Apostle says, there is one kind of brightness for heavenly bodies and another for earthly ones.</s> 
    <s>Among the heavenly bodies, there is one brightness for the sun, another for the moon, and another for the stars, for one star differs from another in brightness (I Cor. XV, 41).</s> 
    <s>Therefore, the diversity of physical natures shows that each of them did not always have the same existence from itself but received it from the disposition and work of the most omnipotent, unchangeable, and wise Creator.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>If any created thing were of the same nature as the Holy Trinity, which is the one God, it would neither be locally confined, nor would it ever experience change over time, nor would it move from place to place, nor be limited by its own size.</s> 
    <s>All these show that the Maker of such natures is He to whom no place is too wide or too narrow, for He is entirely present in both wide and narrow places.</s> 
    <s>He does not change over time, for He alone can wonderfully organize the volumes of time, not with temporal change but with eternal stability.</s> 
    <s>He does not consider how the series of times passes with the succession and departure of things, nor is He limited by any quantity of mass, for He is not confined by any end.</s> 
    <s>He is not spread through parts of the world by His own parts, as if He would fill larger parts of the world with His larger parts and smaller parts with His smaller parts, yet not infuse His whole self anywhere.</s> 
    <s>For He is the God who says: "I fill heaven and earth" (Jer. XXIII, 24).</s> 
    <s>Therefore, He, the Lord God, ineffably fills and contains all things He made, that is, spirits and bodies, the highest and the lowest, heavenly and earthly, living things and those to which He did not give the ability to live.</s> 
    <s>He is not divided in things that are divided, nor is He changed in things that change by any change.</s> 
    <s>For if He were not naturally unchangeable, the unchangeable order of His counsel and disposition would never remain in mutable things.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>God, therefore, the creator of both corporeal and incorporeal things, is immense.</s> 
    <s>He first shows that He is not a body by the fact that He did not give life to some bodies, although He created all bodies.</s> 
    <s>He Himself is naturally life because if He were not life, He would not have made bodies that live.</s> 
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>It does not make a non-living thing unless it is a living thing.</s>
    <s>So, bodies that cannot live at all are not of the same nature as God.</s>
    <s>Similarly, those bodies are not of the same nature as God to which individual brute and irrational spirits, meant to give life and sensation to these bodies, are attached.</s>
    <s>But even these brute spirits are not of the same nature as God.</s>
    <s>Although it is known that they have been inserted into bodies to give them life and sensation, no light of understanding has been granted to these spirits themselves, by which they could recognize or love their creator.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Who could dare, with a blasphemous spirit and blind heart, to think or say that even those spirits, which are undoubtedly rational and intellectual, are of the same nature as God, when God is naturally completely unchangeable and immense?</s>
    <s>While God cannot have any diversity within Himself, He shows diversity in His operations within these spirits, which He made rational and intellectual.</s>
    <s>For some, that is, those who are inserted into earthly and mortal bodies, although there is no local movement because they are not partially present in the parts of physical locations, but are whole within the whole bodies and whole within the parts of those same bodies, the variety of their thoughts shows a certain temporal movement and change.</s>
    <s>Sometimes they do not know something, then they know it; sometimes they want something, then they do not; sometimes they are wise, then they are foolish; sometimes they are unjust from being just, then they are just from being unjust; sometimes they are illuminated by the light of piety, then they are corrupted by the dark error of impiety.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Who does not see that those spirits, which are not burdened by any muddy matter of earthly bodies—that is, angelic spirits—are not of the same nature as God, but made from nothing?</s>
    <s>Their natural mutability is known in that a part of the same nature has been changed for the worse.</s>
    <s>Moreover, those who have not been corrupted, although by the gift of Him who made them from nothing, they receive the sweetness of the Lord with tireless, perfect love, contemplation, and joy as much as is freely given to the angelic creatures, and they do not fall away from Him by natural condition.</s>
    <s>Even if there is no temporal variety in those who adhere to God, because they feel no change within themselves due to the gift of eternal incorruption and immutability granted to them, each one has a natural limit by which they are distinguished from each other, because none of them is in another.</s>
    <s>And when any work is assigned to one of them, another is also appointed by divine power to fulfill another task.</s>
    <s>All these things show that even the holy angels are creatures of the Holy Trinity, whose marvelous wisdom in arrangement and power in action appear through each thing that He made as He willed.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, God created some spirits to always exist, and some to cease existing at some point.</s>
    <s>He made some of those destined to cease existing from water, and some from earth, as the Almighty willed.</s>
    <s>He created the higher spirits to have no natural association with bodily elements but created them eternal and gave them the faculty and intelligence to think about, know, and love divinity.</s>
    <s>Yet, He created them in such a way that they would also love Him above themselves, recognizing that they were created as such by His work, even though no merits of theirs preceded their creation as such.</s>
    <s>To ensure that this love would have just and fitting praise, He also granted them the freedom of will: so that it would be possible for them to direct their intention of holy love toward Him above them or to themselves or to things below them, through wrongful desire.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    Therefore, it is not in the nature of anything to exist forever, whether it lives miserably or happily, unless it can think of God by God's own gift. This intellectual nature is found in the souls of humans and the spirits of angels. God gave only angels and humans the ability to know and love Him. Because of free will, which the Creator in His kindness (or goodness) gave to intellectual creatures, He granted the ability and will to know and love Him so that each could both possess and lose it. However, if anyone willingly lost this, they could not regain it by their own choice. The beginning of this holy thought was to be renewed by the free gift of goodness, to infuse it into whom He willed. It was He who, at the very start of creation, arranged spirits and bodies in their places and conditions according to His wise will, wonderfully ordering them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, angels and humans, being made rational, received the gift of eternity and blessedness at the creation of their spiritual nature. This meant that if they clung continually to the love of their Creator, they would remain eternal and blessed. If, however, they tried to follow their own will against the command of their supreme Creator by their free choice, blessedness would immediately depart from the rebellious, and eternal misery would be left for them, to be tormented by errors and pains. Regarding the angels, it was decreed and fulfilled that if any of them lost the goodness of their will, they could never restore it by divine gift.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, the part of the angels that turned away from their Creator God, in whom alone they were blessed, found the beginning of their damnation in their voluntary turning away. To start being punished was nothing other than being deprived of the love of that blessed good. God commanded that they remain in eternal punishment, preparing for them an eternal fire. In this fire, all rebellious angels could never be free from evil will or punishment. As the evil of unjust turning away remained in them, so too did the just retribution of eternal damnation. The leader of these evils, the devil, led the first humans to the downfall of sin out of envy, and he inserted the merit of death with the vice of sin into their entire progeny. But God, merciful and just, just as He confirmed the rest of the angels in the eternity of His love when the devil and his angels fell by their own will, did not allow the whole mass of humanity to perish forever. Instead, His free goodness predestined to lead back to light those whom He willed, freeing them from the darkness in which all human nature is involved due to the condemnation of original sin. This especially showed that He would release these from the bonds of original sin by the undeserved grace of the liberator, while eternal damnation would hold others, especially infants, in an unbreakable bond, to whom no personal merits, good or bad, can belong.
  </p>
  <p>
    The beginning of good will and thought does not arise from man himself, but is prepared and given to him by God.
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>
      It shows that neither the devil nor any of his angels, since they were cast down into this lower darkness due to their fall, could or will ever regain a good will.
    </s>
    <s>
      If it had been possible for human nature, after turning away from God and losing the goodness of will, to regain it on its own, it would have been much more possible for the angelic nature, which, being less burdened by the weight of an earthly body, would have been more endowed with this ability.
    </s>
    <s>
      But God showed where the good will is given to humans, which the angels lost and once lost, can never have again.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, since the same good will is worthy of the reward of eternal happiness by God's grace, and angelic and human wickedness should not go unpunished, according to the rule of the Catholic faith, we faithfully expect the Son of God to come to punish all sinful angels and to judge the living and the dead.
    </s>
    <s>
      For blessed Peter testifies that God did not spare the angels who sinned but cast them into the gloomy dungeons of hell, to be reserved for judgment and punishment (II Peter 2:4).
    </s>
    <s>
      Blessed Paul also says this about judging the living and the dead: "I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom" (II Tim 4:1).
    </s>
    <s>
      At His coming, all human bodies, from that of the first man whom God formed from the earth to all the bodies of humans who have ever started to live, will be resurrected by Him who created them.
    </s>
    <s>
      Each body will be reunited with its soul in the resurrection, which began in their mothers' wombs to start living, so that souls in the judgment of the righteous Judge will receive their recompense in these same individual bodies, whether of the kingdom or of punishment, in which they had either a good or bad quality of life in the present.

      The quality of a sinful life begins with unbelief, which starts from the guilt of original sin.

    <s>
      Whoever begins to live in this way, if they end their life before being freed from its obligation, even if they only lived in the body for one day or one hour, must endure the endless punishments of hell with that same body, where the devil and his angels will burn forever, who first sinned and persuaded the first humans to sin.

      Along with him will be fornicators, idol worshipers, adulterers, the effeminate, men who have sex with men, thieves, the greedy, drunkards, slanderers, extortioners, and all who do the works of the flesh [of whom the blessed Apostle says, "they will not inherit the kingdom of God" (Gal 5:21)], if they have not turned from their evil ways before the end of this life, will be burned in eternal fires.
    </s>
    <s>
      For every person who continues in the delight of iniquities and the hardness of heart until the end in this world, just as the harmful delight of sins held them here, so eternal torment without end will hold them.

      Showing that the righteous will be changed by divine gift, he says, "And we will be changed" (Ibid., 52).
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, the wicked will have the common resurrection of the flesh with the righteous, but they will not have the grace of transformation, which will be given to the righteous; because the corruption, dishonor, and weakness in which they are sown will not be removed from the bodies of the wicked.

    He gives the perseverance of living well until the end. In their very bodies, in which they received the grace of justification from God here, and in which they lived justified by faith, in the love of God and neighbor, they will enjoy the eternal happiness of the heavenly kingdom. Their bodies, which will be glorified, will retain their true nature of flesh, which God created, but they will be spiritual, not like animals as they are here. The bodies of the saints are sown as natural bodies but will rise as spiritual bodies. Through this transformation, which will be given only to the righteous, what the Apostle says will be fulfilled: "This perishable body must put on imperishability, and this mortal body must put on immortality." The male and female sexes, as their bodies were created, will remain. Their glory will vary according to the diversity of their good deeds. However, all bodies, whether male or female, that are in that kingdom will be glorious. The judge knows how much glory to give to each because in this life, He precedes by justifying them freely through mercy, those whom He plans to glorify there with justice.
