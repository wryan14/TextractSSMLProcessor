On the Order of BaptismBook To Magnus of Sens
by Theodulf Bishop of Orleans

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:01:37,896
To the most reverend and beloved brother Magnus, Theodulf sends greetings. I have fulfilled your command, venerable Magnus, and if not with diligent efficiency, then at least with full obedience. You commanded me, or rather, through you, charity commanded, that I should briefly and quickly respond to certain questions concerning the order of baptism sent to you by our lord and glorious Emperor Charles.
Pressed by the brevity that compelled me to explain great matters in brief words, and the shortness of time that made me wish to quickly fulfill your orders, I have completed what you commanded. If only this work had been done as effectively as it was willingly undertaken! Although I had no opportunity to treat the matter at length and consult the volumes of the Fathers due to certain occupations, charity moved me to fulfill your command: I wrote swiftly about each point that came to my mind, and sent it to your brotherhood so that, if the responses do not provide benefit, at least the obedience might bear fruit.
Meanwhile, as I am certain you know, these questions were not made out of a necessity to learn by royal command, but out of a desire to teach: not so that you yourself, by resolving them, might be instructed about unknown things, but so that others may be awakened from the sleep of lazy torpor to the benefit of accomplishing tasks.
For it is always familiar to him to engage bishops in the investigation of the Holy Scriptures and sound and sober doctrine, all the clergy in discipline, philosophers in the knowledge of divine and human matters, monks in religion, everyone generally in holiness, leaders in counsel, judges in justice, soldiers in the experience of arms, prelates in humility, subjects in obedience, everyone generally in prudence, justice, fortitude, temperance, and concord.

00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:52,799
With these and similar actions, that excellent man, with God on his side, continuously elevates the prestige of the holy Church.
In his remarkable management of both ecclesiastical and civil matters, he is energetic, brimming with wisdom, and triumphs through his display of virtue.

4
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:45,840
1. Why an infant becomes a catechumen.
The ancient custom is preserved in the way infants become catechumens.
Those who came to the apostles as believers to be baptized were first instructed and taught by them. After learning about the sacrament of baptism and other rules of faith, they received the holy mystery of baptism.
As the Apostle says: "Do you not know, brothers, that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?" (Romans 6:3).
These words show that those who were baptized were aware of the mysteries of baptism.
The Lord did not simply say, "Go, baptize," but, "Go, and teach all nations, baptizing them" (Matthew 28:19).
This means that one must first instruct and teach the person who is to be baptized, and then baptize them.
Therefore, infants also become hearers and catechumens, not because they can be instructed and taught at the same age, but to preserve the ancient custom. The apostles first taught and instructed those they were about to baptize, as has already been mentioned.

5
00:02:45,840 --> 00:03:30,695
2. What a catechumen is.
A catechumen is someone who listens or is being instructed.
Humanity listens and is instructed before coming to baptism.
Just as it once heard through Moses, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one"
Deuteronomy 6:4,
and was instructed through the laws and prophets to worship the one true God,
now, through the ministry of priests, listening enables one to be instructed.
Leaving behind the practices of worshiping created things, they now worship the Creator God alone.
Thus, catechumens believe in Christ while still bearing their sins.
As it is said in the Gospel, "But Jesus did not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people"
John 2:24.
Therefore, those who were taught or instructed and baptized by John,
since his baptism could not remove sins, are to be understood as prefiguring the catechumens.

6
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:53,543
3. Why is it exorcised?
A priest makes the sign of the cross on their faces during exorcism to drive away the devil and prepare a path for Christ.
This is because, through his deceitful persuasion, the devil had inhabited the human race since it first received the breath of life.
By the power and sacred sign of the priest's ministry, the devil is forced to leave.
This is similar to how Christ breathed on his disciples and rebuked unclean spirits.

7
00:03:53,543 --> 00:04:53,495
4. Why it is exorcised.
The evil spirit is exorcised so that it may leave the being it has possessed since long ago due to the sin of the first man.
According to the Apostle, there is no agreement between Christ and Belial, nor any partnership between light and darkness (First Corinthians 6:15).
Let the darkness depart and let the true light, Christ, enter.
In Zechariah, symbolically because of our sins, which He bore in His body, Christ is described as wearing filthy garments (Zechariah 3:3).
Rebuking Satan, He chose Jerusalem, symbolizing the holy Church, the Vision of Peace, which He blesses daily with new offspring.
As the prophet says: Your sons will come from afar, and your daughters will be carried in the arms (Isaiah 60:4).
Exorcism is a word of rebuke or adjuration.
In the Acts of the Apostles, exorcists are mentioned, and the holy Church maintains the ministry of exorcists among its ranks.
When exorcism is performed, it targets the one who opposes baptism, the salvation of the faithful, and all virtues.
When the spirit is expelled, the divine word enriches the believers.

8
00:04:53,495 --> 00:06:47,207
5. Why does a catechumen receive salt?
Those who are to be baptized receive salt as a sacrament so that by its taste, they may perceive the seasoning of wisdom and not be deceived by the flavor of Christ, becoming tasteless and foolish.
For he who said to his disciples, "You are the salt of the earth" (Matthew 5:13), also said, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of heaven" (Luke 9:62).
So, those who are baptized may be fit for the kingdom of heaven and not look back by repeating past sins and become a pillar of salt, remaining senseless and serving as an example of their punishment to season others. They ought to receive the salt of wisdom.
Whatever in them is weak and unstable may be cured by the salt of God's word, and according to the Apostle, they should remember Lot's wife.
Just as Elisha cured the barrenness of water by adding salt, so our Lord Jesus Christ, the true Elisha, with the flavor of His word leads the barrenness of human nature to the sweet taste of faith and good works.
The firmness of this faith shines clearly when the one who had heard that only the worship of God is to be maintained, from which he was called and began to be instructed in the worship of true religion, from which he was called a catechumen, and through exsufflation and exorcism was rescued from the evil spirit, and in the giving of salt already began to have the taste of the divine word, is entrusted with the symbol, that is, the complete and unshaken confession of true faith.
So that the house, having been left by its former inhabitant, may be adorned with faith, and from which the thorns of unbelief have been uprooted, the teachings of true faith may begin to be planted in it.
For first, the thorns of unbelief or vices must be uprooted, and then the rudiments of faith and good works must be planted.
Hence, the Lord crushed seven nations before the children of Israel, which held the type of vices, and in their place, in the type of virtues, He established the Israelite people.
He says to the prophet Jeremiah, "See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant" (Jeremiah 1:10).

9
00:06:47,207 --> 00:07:09,527
First, he spoke of uprooting, destruction, scattering, and dispersing. Then he mentioned building and planting. Through the same prophet, he said:
"Just as I watched over them to uproot and tear down, and to overthrow, destroy, and bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant"
Jeremiah 31:28.
This is because, after the exorcism and blowing away, the tradition of the creed follows.

10
00:07:09,527 --> 00:08:50,711
6. What is the interpretation of the Creed according to the Latins?
The word "symbol" in Latin is interpreted as "sign," "indication," or "comparison." It is called an indication because it shows the integrity of faith; a sign because, by properly retaining and understanding it, the faithful are distinguished from the unbelievers; and a comparison because, in it, the apostles brought together the entire integrity of faith.
What they all held in their hearts with equal sincerity of faith, they confessed with their mouths, and each contributed their own understanding, producing a symbol, that is, a collection of the entire faith. As they were about to part from each other, they established a standard for future preaching, so that when they went their separate ways, they would not teach anything different or conflicting.
It was indeed very fitting and useful that those who had one soul and one heart in the Lord, and who were invigorated by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, would also be united in the confession of one faith. For they could not and should not be divided in any way, being bound by the bond of one faith.
Meanwhile, some people want to understand the "concise word" mentioned through the prophet Isaiah in the Creed and the Lord's Prayer. For in one is contained the integrity of faith, and in the other, the integrity of prayers, so that in the twelve words is contained the doctrine of the twelve apostles, and in the seven petitions is contained everything that pertains to the management of the present and future life.
Even though the entire doctrine can also be called concise, because what the law and the prophets previously contained in the breadth of commandments, the Lord came and summarized by saying, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and your neighbor as yourself." On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
Matthew 22:37. In this, he clearly abbreviates the prophets and the law into these two statements.
These things are said about the Creed and its name.

11
00:08:50,711 --> 00:10:21,384
7. On Belief: How to believe in God the Father Almighty, in Jesus Christ His Son, in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, and the other elements of the Creed.
The faith outlined in this Creed should be understood by those about to be baptized, so they believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of all things visible and invisible, who alone is called unbegotten because He is not from another.
And in Jesus Christ His Son, through whom all things were made, true God and only-begotten Son of God, not made or adopted, but begotten and of one substance with the Father, thus equal in all things to God the Father.
He is neither inferior in time, rank, nor power, and is as great as He who begot Him.
They should also believe that He was born of the Holy Spirit from Mary, ever a virgin: meaning, with the Holy Spirit's cooperation, the same Son of God took on a true body from the virgin.
He who was the Son of God the Father in divinity, became the Son of a human mother in humanity.
They should also believe that He descended in the last days for the redemption of the world from the Father, who never ceased to be with the Father, and became a true man to free humankind.
He, who possesses eternity with the Father and the Holy Spirit without beginning, took on a perfect man of our nature at the end of the ages, and the Word became flesh, assuming humanity without changing divinity.
They should also believe that He endured suffering and death, not by the power of divinity, but in the weakness of humanity, died a real death of the flesh, rose again with a real resurrection of the flesh, and with His resurrection gave us hope of our own resurrection.
Just as He rose alive from the dead on the third day, so we too shall rise at the end of the ages in the same flesh in which we now live.

12
00:10:21,384 --> 00:11:43,872
They should also believe that He, in the same body He assumed from the Virgin, suffered, died, resurrected, ascended into heaven, and is now there, and will come for judgment. After raising everyone, He will pronounce the sentence of eternal punishment to some for their sins and the reward of eternal bliss to others for their righteousness.
They should also believe in the Holy Spirit, the true God who proceeds from the Father and the Son, equal in every respect to the Father and the Son in will, power, eternity, and substance. In this holy Trinity, there are no degrees by which anyone can be said to be inferior or superior.
They should also believe in the holy Catholic Church, which is universal, not just in the holy Church's belief in the Trinity. They should believe that the holy Church is the house of the same holy Trinity. Those who depart from its communion are called schismatics and heretics and are punished with eternal damnation. But those who remain in its communion are members of Christ, receive the forgiveness of sins, and belong to eternal life.
Since infants, who do not yet use reason, cannot understand these things at all, it is necessary that when they reach an age of understanding, they be taught these things, the sacraments of faith, and the mysteries of their confession, so that they may truly believe these things and keep them with diligent care.
We clearly said their confession because, although they cannot yet speak, those who receive them from the font of baptism confess and speak for them. It is only fitting that those who are subject to the sins of others should also receive the remission of original sins through the confession of others by the mystery of baptism.

13
00:11:43,872 --> 00:12:31,800
8. On the Examination.
Those who are of sufficient age to explain their faith should be carefully examined to determine whether they truly believe or if there is any trace of falsehood within them.
This is to prevent them from coming to the sacrament of baptism out of fear, favor of earthly powers, or for the acquisition of certain things, without the Church ministers knowing it.
Thus, avoiding giving what is holy to dogs, casting pearls before swine, and allowing wolves to dress in sheep's clothing.
The Church customarily maintains this practice: for several days, those who are to be baptized at the Easter celebration are examined, so that the sacraments of life may be given to those who are taught, instructed, and come with a sincere heart to true faith.
To ensure they are more suitable for the sacrament of baptism and that their faith is more credible, some physical actions are performed which, when understood spiritually, have a mystical and spiritual significance.

14
00:12:31,800 --> 00:14:23,472
9. Why are the ears and nostrils touched with spit?
The nostrils and ears are touched with spit, and it is said: Effeta.
The nostrils are touched so they may follow Christ in the fragrance of perfumes and say: Draw me, we will run after you (Song of Solomon 1:3).
With the Apostle, they may declare: We are the pleasing aroma of Christ to God (Second Corinthians 2:15).
They may become members of Him to whom it is said: And the scent of your garments is better than all spices (Song of Solomon 4:10).
One will then be able to have that scent well if, like Mary, whose name means lady or illuminator, they anoint the feet of Jesus with an alabaster jar of ointment, that is, with the purity of holy faith and the practice of good works.
By fulfilling the teachings of the apostles or any preachers through whom Christ walks, the house, that is, the world or the whole of the Holy Church, is filled with their good reputation, like a kind of sweet and pleasant fragrance.
And because often the sweetness of the scent and the various perfumes are suited to the self-indulgent and lovers, these, on the contrary, having become chaste and lovers of Christ, always embrace only His life-giving scent.
The ears are also touched, so that hearing the words of God and doing them, they may be like the wise man in the Gospel who built his house on the rock (Matthew 7:24).
With spiritual hearing, they always listen to spiritual things, so they may say with David: I will hear what the Lord God speaks in me (Psalm 85:9), and with Isaiah: The Lord God opened my ear, and I did not resist, I did not turn back (Isaiah 50:5).
Hearing spiritually what is said spiritually, they may reach the benefits of spiritual works.
When the Lord says in the Gospel: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Matthew 11:15), and John in his Revelation: He who has ears to hear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches (Revelation 2:7); here not physical ears are sought, but spiritual ones, and by the name of the ears, the hearing of the inner man is meant.
For in sacred speech, often the virtues of the soul are understood through the members of the body.

15
00:14:23,472 --> 00:15:00,336
Since divinity took on human form, creating a kind of ointment from the connection of two substances in one person of the Son of God, to enlighten the human race that was born blind from the first parents, it is not without reason that the ears and nose are touched with saliva.
Just as He touched the mute man's tongue with His spit and made mud with His saliva to open the eyes of the man born blind, now, through the ministry of priests, He grants spiritual hearing to those who are to be baptized, gives them the ability to speak rightly, that is, to confess true faith, and opens their noses to perceive the good fragrance of Christ.
The chest of the one who is baptized should always be filled with the nectar of divine fragrance and anointed with spiritual ointment.

16
00:15:00,336 --> 00:16:06,936
10. Why is the chest anointed with oil, or the shoulders marked or anointed?
The chest and shoulders of those who are to be baptized are touched with oil to soothe them with the holy oil, representing the Holy Spirit.
As the Apostle says, "As His anointing teaches us about all things" (First John 2:27), they are protected both in front and behind-that is, they are mindful of all things, whether good or bad.
Like the heavenly creatures that are full of eyes in front and behind, they look to the past and the future to guard their salvation.
The chest is touched so they can say with David: "And His mercy comes before me" (Psalm 59:10).
The shoulders are touched so they can say with him: "And His mercy follows me" (Psalm 23:6).
This means they look forward to doing good and backward to avoid doing it in vain.
To will and to act are given to us by Him from whom comes every good and perfect gift.
And since the heart often signifies the mind, as in "I have sought You with my whole heart" (Psalm 119:10), and oil signifies the anointing of the Holy Spirit or works of light and mercy, the heart is protected by anointing on both sides-front and back.
Thus, the mind of a Christian is abundantly filled with the richness of the Holy Spirit and with works of light and mercy.

17
00:16:06,936 --> 00:17:27,624
11. What is renunciation? It is greatly beneficial if, by renouncing the devil and his works, one rejects his dominion.
The yoke that oppressed them is broken by the anointing oil, fulfilling the prophecy: "The yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil" Isaiah 10:27.
To renounce is commonly understood to mean to spurn, reject, contradict, or express something similar.
Although the meaning of the word "nuntio" is straightforward when used without a prefix, and it sometimes doesn't stray far from its usual meaning when a prefix is added, as in "I will tell and declare" Psalm 55:18, sometimes it takes on a different meaning, as in "So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple" Luke 14:33.
However, "abrenuntiare" (to renounce) always retains the meaning we mentioned earlier.
To renounce is to confess to abandoning Satan, all his works, and all his pomp.
This renunciation is rightly followed by the confession of the Holy Trinity, so that where sin abounded, grace may abound even more.
Where the yoke of the devil has decayed because of the anointing of the Holy Spirit, the yoke of Him who said, "Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" Matthew 11:29, may come.
Satan, who is also called the devil, is renounced by the faithful so that they may serve God the Savior more freely.
According to the words of the same Lord, "No one can serve two masters" Luke 16:13.

18
00:17:27,624 --> 00:19:07,248
12. On Renouncing Satan and All His Works and Showiness, or the Works and Showiness of the Devil
We also renounce his works because they are opposed to the works of the Savior. Using his weapons-vices-he has subjected the human race to himself. The Lord, however, overcame him with His weapons-virtues.
In the devil's army, represented by our sins and servitude, we receive death; in the Lord's army, represented by virtues, we receive eternal life.
The seven principal vices with which the devil harasses humanity can reasonably be called the works of Satan. Opposed to these vices are the seven principal virtues, which are undoubtedly works of salvation.
We also renounce his showiness, which are indeed works of Satan. They seem to differ from his other works in that they reflect pride, of which he is the author and which led to his downfall.
His showiness includes ambition, arrogance, vainglory, and similar traits, all recognized as stemming from pride.
The prophetic word suggests that pomp, ambition, boasting, and similar traits should be understood in this context when it says:
"Woe to those who are at ease in Zion, and to those who feel secure on the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the first of the nations, to whom the house of Israel comes!"
Amos 6:1.
Clement Prudentius, the eloquent and Christian poet, also used the term "pomp" in this sense in his book Psychomachia where he says:
"Pomp, the showy splendor of empty vanity, is stripped away, laid bare."
While every sin can be considered prideful-since sinning opposes God who forbids it-there are different ways to sin: lazily, maliciously, knowingly, ignorantly, negligently, or arrogantly.
No matter how one sins, if they despise repentance, they plunge into the great abyss of pride. To emerge from this, they must confess their sins, amend their ways, and seek the aid of saving penance.

19
00:19:07,248 --> 00:19:34,176
There are two ways a person can be prideful before God: either by disobeying His commandments and committing what is forbidden, or by neglecting to repent for what has been committed.
Whether we are about to be baptized or have already received the sacrament, we should remember the covenant made with God during baptism, where we renounce Satan, his works, and his pomps.
This covenant becomes void if someone, while remaining in the faith, succumbs to vices or deviates from the faith to idol worship or the errors of heresies.

20
00:19:34,176 --> 00:21:00,240
13. Believers have two key commitments: renouncing the devil and his works, and professing faith in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It's essential to uphold these commitments firmly and seek the help of the one who granted the sacrament of baptism for humanity's salvation, so they remain pure.
This was foreshadowed in the Old Testament through Moses, when the people were baptized in the cloud and the sea, and clearly shown to us in the New Testament by the mediator between God and humans.
For He Himself said, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven (John 3:3).
And John said of Him: I baptize you with water for repentance, but among you stands one you do not know, who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire (Matthew 3:11; John 1:26).
Through this, we are reborn to God, transforming from children of wrath through sin to children of God through grace.
This washing and bath renew the Church.
Just as the woman was formed from the rib of the sleeping first man, the Church was formed from the side of Christ on the cross.
From His side flowed blood and water, representing the two chief sacraments of the holy Church, providing consecration and cleansing.
We are reborn through washing and consecrated by blood.
This is why the people crossed the Red Sea, as Christ's baptism is consecrated by blood.
Because water is more suitable than any other element for purifying, giving life, and renewing, it is rightfully given the dignity of baptism.
Water held the power to regenerate humans when the Spirit of God moved over it at the beginning of the world, and it gained the dignity of purifying when it flowed from the side of Christ.

21
00:21:00,240 --> 00:22:41,928
This visible element symbolizes an invisible reality. Just as water cleanses the body externally, the soul is secretly purified by the Holy Spirit through its mystery.
When God is invoked, the Holy Spirit descends from heaven and grants the sanctified waters the power to purify.
Thus, the person restored to the image of the Holy Trinity, in which they were originally created, expels the old self that entered through the sin of the first human. This old self is replaced by a new self through the grace of Christ.
Transformed by the spirit of grace, they become entirely different. Once defiled by the ugliness of sins, they are now made beautiful by the whitening of virtues.
Therefore, the mystery of baptism cannot be completed without invoking the Holy Trinity. As the Lord said to the apostles: "Go, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28:19).
The same Lord affirmed this sacrament at His own baptism, where the Father was revealed in the voice, the Son in the body, and the Holy Spirit in the appearance of a dove.
O splendid and marvelous sacrament, which transforms children of wrath into children of God, the old into new, the defiled into beautiful. It is in this sacrament that we are both reborn and purified, imitating the example of Christ's death.
How do we imitate this example, says the Apostle? "Do you not know," he says, "that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? Therefore, we were buried with Him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life" (Romans 6:3).
We die to sin when we renounce the devil and all his works. We are buried with Christ when, under the invocation of the Holy Trinity and with three immersions in the font, we descend as if into a tomb. We rise with Christ when, stripped of all sins, we emerge from the font as if from a tomb.

22
00:22:41,928 --> 00:24:21,312
But the mystery of the three days and nights, during which it is recorded that the Lord was in the tomb, is not overlooked. When we invoke the Holy Trinity, which is indeed the true light, we descend into the font. For the Father is light, and in His light, because He is the Son, we see the Holy Spirit as light.
We also observe three nights, opposing the father of darkness and ignorance, along with the lie that was born from him. He is a liar just like his father, and when he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources. But in the third place, we destroy the spirit of error, which inspires false prophets to say, "Thus says the Lord," whom the Lord has not sent. We destroy these and trample them if we are buried with Christ, according to what He Himself says: "Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy" (Luke 10:19).
Each of these things is contrary to the Holy Trinity as night is to day, as darkness is to light, as lies are to the truth. The baptismal font also bears the likeness of the tomb of Christ, which is recorded to have been new. Because whoever is buried with Christ in it and rises with Him, according to the same Apostle, must walk in newness of life.
The seven steps of this font seem to signify the three nights in descent and the three days in ascent, as mentioned above. The seventh step, which is also the fourth, is the one about which someone said: "And the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods" (Daniel 3:25). He extinguishes the furnace of fire, which is the stability of the feet, the foundation of water; in whom, according to the Apostle, "all the fullness of divinity dwells bodily" (Colossians 2:9).
Therefore, baptism is not repeated, because Christ dies no more than once. Sins committed after baptism are erased by the tears of repentance, alms, and other displays of good works, not by repeating baptism.

23
00:24:21,312 --> 00:25:03,096
Meanwhile, the purest linens and spices are used for the burial of the Lord's body because, even if someone wishes to be buried with Christ, they should still shine with honorable works and be clothed in clean garments, despite carrying original sin.
The prophet prays that priests be clothed in these when he says: "May your priests be clothed with righteousness" (Psalm one hundred thirty-two verse nine).
If, therefore, before being reborn, cleansed from original sin, and buried with Christ, one ought to shine with spices, have a pleasant fragrance, and be clothed in the cleanest garments, how much more should someone who is reborn, cleansed, brought to life with Christ, walking in newness of life, and made a new creature, overflow with the fragrance of a good odor and shine with the brightness of white garments?

24
00:25:03,096 --> 00:26:40,680
14. Why they are clothed in white garments.
As we die to the world and rise with Christ, let us be clothed in the brightness of good works and strengthened by the hope of heavenly joys. It is fitting that the angel who announces His resurrection is described as sitting in white garments, and those who announce His return to the apostles appear in white garments.
We also put on white garments after baptism to maintain the purity we received during regeneration, preserving our renewal and the beauty of angelic splendor. These white robes symbolize the hope of immortality and eternal happiness. With the prophet, we can say: I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, and my spirit will exult in my God. For He has clothed me with the garment of salvation and wrapped me in the robe of righteousness (Isaiah 61:10).
May He help us keep these garments, as He is the one who gave them to us, so that it can be said of us what is written in Revelation: Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his garments (Revelation 16:15).
Since everything in the context of baptism is filled with mysteries and rich in sacraments, it is fitting that the new person receives new garments and, cleansed of the stain of old guilt, is clothed in the brightness of white garments. Moses washed Aaron and his sons with water first and then clothed them with linen garments. Similarly, our true Moses, who frees the people from Egyptian servitude-from the error of paganism-purifies us with His ineffable sacrament and adorns us with the garments of good works. His face, the manifestation of His divinity, shines like the sun on the mountain of the Church, and His garments, that is, all the saints, become as white as wool or snow.
Let us give thanks to Him, as Revelation says, who washed us from our sins with His blood and made us a kingdom and priests to His God and Father, to whom be glory forever and ever (Revelation 1:5-6).

25
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:48,240
This kingdom and priesthood are anointed with the visible oil of chrism through the ministry of priests, and with the invisible grace of the Holy Spirit by the Lord.

26
00:26:48,240 --> 00:27:44,088
15. Why is the head anointed with holy chrism?
The sacrament of this oil is first mentioned in Exodus, where Moses, following God's command, prepares it.
In the New Testament, this is affirmed by the Lord, who was anointed by the Father with the oil of gladness above his companions. God gives him the Spirit without measure, because in him dwells all the fullness of divinity bodily.
The Church says to him: "Your name is oil poured out, therefore the maidens love you" (Song of Solomon 1:2). From the chrism of Christ and from Christ, the name of Christians has arisen.
Before his coming, only kings and priests were anointed, and they were also called Christs.
After his coming, however, not only kings and priests but the whole Church is consecrated with this anointing, because it is considered a kingdom and priesthood, and its children kings and priests.
Therefore, the heads of the baptized are anointed with chrism, so that they, anointed in the kingdom and priesthood of the Church, may receive the prerogative of the Christian name and may become members of him who redeemed them and is their head.

16. Why it is covered with a mystical veil.
Our Redeemer is both a king and a priest. As the prophet says, "Your kingdom, Lord, is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations" (Psalm 145:13). He triumphantly defeated the devil, death, and the world. The same prophet also says, "You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek" (Psalm 110:4). He offered himself as a sacrifice to God the Father. It is fitting that his holy Church, being his body, should be both a kingdom and a priesthood. We, who are reborn into it and are its members, should be kings and priests.
As kings, we bravely fight against the devil and manage our lives admirably. As priests, we build an altar of faith in God's holy temple, which we are, offering him the peaceful sacrifices of good works. We can say with the Apostle: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in Christ" (Ephesians 1:3).
From this altar, the smoke of our prayers should rise to him daily, as the prophet says: "May my prayer be set before you like incense" (Psalm 141:2).
The heads of those who are reborn by water and the Holy Spirit are covered with a mystical veil. Peter says to them: "You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession" (First Peter 2:9). This veil signifies both the royal diadem and the covering of the priestly head. In sacred scripture, the head often signifies the mind, as in, "Lift up your heads" (Luke 21:28). The mind of the reborn should have the adornments of royal dignity and the covering of the priestly head. It should be protected against vices by the priestly veil, spiritually adorned with the gems of virtues, and anointed with the holy chrism.

28
00:29:22,704 --> 00:29:34,536
They are also granted the sevenfold grace of the Spirit through the anointing of chrism, making them worthy to become not just the dwelling place of the Spirit, who is of one substance with the Father and the Son, but of the entire Holy Trinity.

29
00:29:34,536 --> 00:31:12,384
17. The ancient tradition of the Church, passed down from the apostles, states that while priests can anoint the baptized with chrism, they cannot bestow the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands.
As it is written in the Acts of the Apostles:
"It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper regions and came to Ephesus, where he found some disciples. He asked them, 'Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?' They answered, 'No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.' Paul then asked, 'Into what then were you baptized?' They replied, 'Into John's baptism.' Paul explained, 'John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.' When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying" (Acts 19:1-6).
Again, in another passage:
"When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. When they arrived, they prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit. For He had not yet come upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit" (Acts 8:14-17).
Finally, it should be understood that just as the other sacraments of baptism are visibly performed by priests but invisibly consecrated by God, the grace of the Holy Spirit is conferred through the laying on of hands and the ministry of bishops.
Although priests are also priests, they do not possess the highest rank of the episcopate. It is shown not only by ecclesiastical custom but also by the earlier reading from the Acts of the Apostles that it belongs solely to bishops to either sign or bestow the Holy Spirit, as it asserts that Peter and John were sent to hand over the Holy Spirit to those already baptized.

30
00:31:12,384 --> 00:33:04,056
For priests, whether the bishops are absent or present, it is permitted to baptize and anoint the baptized with chrism, but only if it has been consecrated by a bishop. However, it is not allowed to mark the forehead with the same oil, which is reserved for bishops alone when they impart the Holy Spirit.
The Holy Spirit, also called the sevenfold grace, is referred to because of the mystery of the number seven, in which the highest perfection is understood. It is composed of the first whole even number and the first whole odd number: the first whole even number, which can be divided, and the first whole odd number, which cannot be divided. It holds the mystery of the Trinity in the three and the Gospel in the four. Whether three is multiplied by four, or four by three, the number twelve is reached, because the mystery of the Holy Trinity and the teaching of the Gospel were spread by the twelve apostles to the four parts of the world, namely the east, west, north, and south. This number is customarily used in sacred scripture to represent perfection.
For God rested on the seventh day after completing His works, and Enoch, who is the seventh from Adam, walked with the Lord, and his translation gave us hope for eternal rest. Hence, the Jubilee year, which signifies complete rest, is made up of seven weeks. Seven times seven is 49, which, when one is added, completes our unity. The prophet praises the perfection of this number when he says: "Seven times a day I praise you" (Psalm 119:164). This is clarified in another psalm when he says: "His praise shall continually be in my mouth" (Psalm 34:1). And John, in his Revelation, when he writes to the seven churches, is generally believed to have written to the entire Catholic Church. Hence he also says: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" (Revelation 2:7).
Meanwhile, concerning the number seven, which in some places in Scripture signifies universality or perfection, and in other places the sevenfold grace of the Spirit, there are many references in both the Old and New Testaments, which are too numerous to detail.

31
00:33:04,056 --> 00:34:54,960
Now let's see how Isaiah the prophet lists the gifts of the sevenfold Spirit. When he was prophesying about Christ, who is the rod of the Lord's power, he said:
"A rod will come out from the root of Jesse, and a flower from his root will rise up, and the Spirit of the Lord will rest upon him-the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and piety, and he will be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord" (Isaiah 11:1).
The Spirit of the Lord rested upon this flower, who came out from the rod of Jesse, that is, from the birth of the blessed Mary ever virgin, because it pleased him to dwell in all the fullness of divinity bodily.
Not partially, as in other saints, to whom some are given the word of wisdom, others the word of knowledge, others the grace of virtues, and so on, which are given to each according to measure, but most fully.
Hence the apostle also said: "God does not give the Spirit by measure" (John 3:34); and the prophet: "Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will bring forth judgment to the nations" (Isaiah 42:1).
So that the Spirit might rest in him with perpetual habitation, it came to him, according to the testimony of John the Baptist, who said, "I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it remained upon him. I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'Upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining, he is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit'" (John 1:32).
This is called the Spirit of the Lord and the spirit of wisdom, because it is written of Christ, who is the wisdom of God, "All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made" (John 1:3); and in the Psalms it is sung: "How great are your works, O Lord, you have made all things in wisdom" (Psalm 104:24).
And in another place, where the Trinity is clearly shown, it is written: "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host" (Psalm 33:6).

32
00:34:54,960 --> 00:36:34,848
Through Christ, who is the Word of the Lord, the Father, as it is written, "In the beginning was the Word" John 1:1, the heavens, that is, the holy preachers who proclaim the glory of God, were made. By the Holy Spirit, who is consubstantial with them and proceeds from both, all their strength and adornment are sustained by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
The Apostle writes, "Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God" First Corinthians 1:24. And in Proverbs, it reads, "The Lord by wisdom founded the earth, by understanding He established the heavens" Proverbs 3:19.
Just as the Word of the Lord is called light, life, and resurrection, so the Spirit of wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, piety, and the fear of the Lord are named. Not because He is different according to these names, but because He is the same source and principle of all virtues.
Without Christ, no one can be wise, understanding, a counselor, strong, learned, or full of the fear of the Lord. It should be known that the Spirit of the Lord, encompassing wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, piety, and the fear of the Lord-the sevenfold number-are called the seven eyes on one stone in Zechariah 3:9. This Spirit rests upon the rod and flower that sprang from Jesse, from the lineage of David.
This same Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, was granted by the Lord to the apostles, and through their ministry and successors, to His holy Church. Although these gifts come from the same source, the one Spirit, they have distinct properties.
Being wise is one thing, and understanding is another. Many are wise about eternal things but cannot understand them. Wisdom fills the mind with hope and certainty of eternal things, while understanding penetrates secrets and enlightens the heart by dispelling darkness. Counsel prevents rashness and fills the mind with reason.

33
00:36:34,848 --> 00:38:25,248
Strength, when it does not fear adversity, provides confidence to a trembling mind.
Knowledge, when it dispels ignorance, illuminates with its light those it fills.
Piety allows those it fills to overflow with acts of mercy.
Fear, while it keeps the mind from being arrogant about present things, comforts it with the hope of future things.
In this way, they support one another, ensuring that as one helps the other, the order and state of life are most fittingly arranged.
Wisdom is indeed less if it lacks understanding, and understanding is very useless if it does not derive from wisdom.
When it penetrates higher matters without the weight of wisdom, its own lightness lifts it to fall more gravely.
Advice is worthless if it lacks the strength of fortitude, because what it discovers through discussion, lacking strength, it does not bring to the perfection of work.
And fortitude is greatly destroyed unless it is supported by advice, because the more it sees itself capable, the more it rushes into ruin without the moderation of reason.
There is no knowledge if it does not have the utility of piety: because while it neglects to perform the known good, it binds itself to stricter judgment.
And piety is very useless if it lacks the discernment of knowledge, because while no knowledge enlightens it, it does not know how to show mercy.
Fear itself, too, if it does not have these virtues, undoubtedly rises to no work of good action: while it trembles at everything, it, paralyzed by its own fear, is idle in all good things.
Therefore, it must be observed with the utmost care, and the help of the Holy Spirit must be implored.
Lest wisdom elevate; lest understanding, while it runs subtly, go astray;
lest advice, while it multiplies, confuse; lest fortitude, while it provides confidence, precipitate;
lest knowledge, while it knows and does not love, puff up; lest piety, while it inclines outside of rectitude, twist;
lest fear, while it trembles more than justly, sink into the pit of despair.
It should be known indeed that these distributions of spiritual gifts in the body of Christ, which is the Church, are supported by these aids.

34
00:38:25,248 --> 00:39:34,632
In the one who is the source of light and the origin of goodness, they reign fully and perfectly, incomparably and ineffably.
For Wisdom, who built both a body for herself in the womb of the Virgin and the Church in the world, has the spirit of wisdom by which she manages everything wisely;
the spirit of understanding, by which she explores all the hidden secrets;
the spirit of counsel, by which she handles everything with great management, because she is the Angel of great counsel;
the spirit of fortitude, because she reaches from one end to the other with strength and cannot be overcome by anyone;
the spirit of knowledge, because she knows everything, except those to whom she will say: "I do not know you" Matthew 25:12;
the spirit of piety, because she created humanity in goodness, condemned it with justice, and redeemed it with piety;
the spirit of fear, for those who need the fear of the Lord because they are little. To them, through the Prophet, she says, "Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord" Psalm 34:12.
Therefore, because he humbled himself by descending to our weaknesses, taking the form of a servant, humbling himself unto death, and bowing down to raise us up who were lying down, it is fitting that the spirit of the Lord, which rests upon him, begins with wisdom and descends through the most appropriate steps to fear.

35
00:39:34,632 --> 00:40:28,968
We are indeed moving away from the fear that love drives out, towards the pure fear that lasts forever. We reach devotion so that, adorned with acts of devotion, we come to knowledge-not the kind that puffs up, but the kind that love builds up. From knowledge, we move to fortitude, so that, adorned with the beauty of knowledge, we might bravely fight against vices. From fortitude, we move to counsel, so that what we do bravely, we might support with the weight of counsel. By obeying counsel in our actions, we enter the mysteries of understanding and come to the wisdom which begins with the fear of the Lord. By wisely completing all things and achieving good understanding, we may be admitted to that wisdom through which all things were made. This wisdom was begotten ineffably by the Father before the ages and, at the end of the ages, took on flesh for the sake of our salvation. This flesh He granted to His faithful to eat when He said: "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you will not have life in you" (John 6:55-56).

36
00:40:28,968 --> 00:41:49,416
18. Why we are completed by the body and blood of the Lord.
To gain this life, we are baptized, fed with His flesh, and given to drink of His blood, because we cannot become part of His body unless we are imbued with these sacraments.
For He Himself said: "My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink" (John 6:54);
and: "Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in them" (John 6:55).
It is a saving sacrifice, which in the Old Testament Melchizedek, king of Salem, offered as a symbol of the Lord's body and blood.
In the New Testament, the same mediator between God and humanity fulfilled it before He was handed over. Taking bread and a cup, blessing them, and giving them to His disciples, He commanded that these things be done in His memory.
Therefore, the Church celebrates this sacrificial mystery, having left behind and completed the old sacrifices. The Church offers bread because of the living bread that came down from heaven, and wine for the one who said, "I am the true vine" (John 15:1).
Through the visible offering of the priests and the invisible consecration of the Holy Spirit, bread and wine may attain the dignity of the Lord's body and blood.
Water is mixed with this blood, either because it flowed from the Lord's side along with blood, or because, as the elders want us to understand, just as Christ is signified by the wine, so the people are signified by the water.
For wine and water are inseparably mixed in the cup because the Church is inseparably joined and united to its head, Christ.

37
00:41:49,416 --> 00:42:43,224
Therefore, the Church upholds the tradition of receiving the Eucharist, as handed down by the Lord, so that when one is reborn of water and the Holy Spirit, they are nourished with the body of the Lord and drink His blood. This ensures that, being incorporated into the body of Christ, they may remain in Christ and Christ in them. Strengthened by the power of this food, they may, like Elijah, reach the mountain of God, which is Christ, the mountain prepared at the summit of the mountains. By His gift, they may approach the glory of eternal happiness, where their desire will be fulfilled with good things, and they may say with the Prophet: "As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness" Psalms 17:15. Behold, venerable man, I have humbly fulfilled what you prudently commanded, praying for your holiness, that when you find higher answers to these inquiries, you may consider them, and not reject these, as long as all things are to be proven by apostolic authority, and what is good is to be retained.
